Speaker 1
Welcome to refrain. All calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. Once you've been connected to a member of our team, we may ask for information to help us verify your identity. Good afternoon. You're speaking to (CST Staff Name), could I take your name please?
Speaker 2
Ashwin, my name is (Patient Name). I was looking to speak to you, (CST Staff Name).
Speaker 1
Yeah. Let me just see if she's available.
Speaker 3
Thank you.
Speaker 4
Hi (Patient Name), thanks for calling in.
Speaker 2
Hi, (CST Staff Name). Hi. How are?
Speaker 4
You. I'm good. Thank you. Yeah, good. Thanks.
Speaker 2
Yeah, thanks. I've seen I've just seen on retraining on the, on the chapter. You've dropped quite a few messages. So I was, I was kind of. Looking through them. Yeah. So yeah, I think the key thing for me, I think the key. Trends between the two treatment plans plans were the talent unite.
Speaker 3
Kind of pronounced.
Speaker 2
Talida, Omide, right, and thalidomide replacement with the Lenalidomide.
Speaker 4
Yes, customise. Yes, yes. Yeah, which is also called.
Speaker 2
Limit. Yes. Yeah, that's easier name. Yeah. Rev limit.
Speaker 4
It gets.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's it's it does.
Speaker 4
Confusing when they've got so many different names.
Speaker 3
It does. It does which?
Speaker 2
Is also called Rev limit so so so I get the impression that the word which is the REVLIMID version is not approved by Nice or the. Right.
Speaker 4
No, it's confusing, isn't it? Seems that way, yeah.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker
Yeah, it is.
Speaker 2
It seems to be in this in between phase where it's not a clinical trial because the Gryphon trials are done and I think it's determined to be you know to be recommended and people are using it here in the UK on a steady not on any but on private.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I would imagine. So I've mentioned it, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So my doctor said it's standard. The standard proposition they give since three years ago for kind of private health people who diagnose. But the key thing for me is that my accent doesn't accept it and access my my. Yeah, so they don't accept that which which is kind of, you know it's fine that their policy because if it's not licenced and they're not accepted and and I think that the combination is is in that in between space between. It's been approved as a trial but is at successful trial, but it hasn't had the commercial agreement that NHS and the rest goes through to make it approved and.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. So I.
Speaker 2
Guess that's what the situation is, but so that in itself is not such a big challenge for me. What I was trying to find out was what's the difference in efficacy.
Speaker 1
OK.
Speaker 2
Between the DTVLA and the Dharavi Audi.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Now that's a difficult one, isn't it? Because trials I haven't managed to find any trials comparing those two.
Speaker 2
The side. Effects, sorry. Right. Right. OK. OK, so the Gryphon trials, was there any results from the Gryphon trials that made it, you know, why did it switch to become the recommended? Was it just because of the side effect reduction of the REVLIMID or you know of the efficacy?
Speaker 4
Oh, no, that's OK. Sorry, I lost you a.
Speaker 3
Bit there, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, sorry, I was trying my. Best to find a a study comparing the two, but it seems to be really finding any statistics on it.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. So you couldn't find anything?
Speaker 4
Through the one I could find, I'm just wondering whether if either, if any. Of the doctors. Now would be happy to sort of, you know, direct us to where to look. Because they must be. You know, they must be reading it. Maybe. In the British. Medical journal or somewhere or something that they've had an update from the actual drug companies themselves.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, because I think what Doctor Boyd is kind of one of the lead. In you know, multiple myeloma experts in the UK anyway, it seems. I mean what they've told me is that the efficacy is pretty much the same and that the only difference is the the neuro party from the the two drugs.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Four of the four, two of them caused the neuropathy, which is the kind of nerve. Nerve challenges in the in the tools and the hands. I don't know which ones. I don't know whether there are two mobile, but I know one of them is. Talino palomides.
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's the for those in.
Speaker 2
And yes.
Speaker 4
Mind. And it's the the VELCADE which is the Bortezomib.
Speaker 2
Extra method.
Speaker 4
The other one, the. Board the board has some up.
Speaker 2
Oh, there, there are. There are some. Of them, there's folk. Can you tell me the OK?
Speaker 4
No, no, no, no, no, it's not not the. Yeah, the four in there. So you. Got the daratumumab which is in both of them, obviously, which is to me is the most important one that is the you.
Speaker 2
It is, yes.
Speaker 4
Know the new. Immunotherapy that's most effective. So I think that's the one, thank. Goodness, they're giving you.
Speaker 2
And that's in both. That's in both. That's in both the only the only difference, the only difference with the the the you might have noticed is that when you go into maintenance. So the two years of maintenance you cannot have there are two of us.
Speaker 4
That was yes.
Speaker 2
In the in the DTVLA you can only have Rev limit right, whereas in the dira VCR the in the two years maintenance they give you the.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 2
Oh, OK. Yeah. So I don't know whether you know it. If you complete. Yes. Yes. Yeah. If you compare the two. So not 7. Not the not the not the seven months period, but after the six months period in the maintenance.
Speaker 4
Ah, I haven't realised that I'll have to have a look at the moment, OK?
Speaker 2
That's the key difference. The key difference is you cannot have that. There are some of which which actually you know, my doctor was a bit concerned about, but you know, but you cannot have it if you've done the the the the DTV rather than the Dara VD with the.
Speaker
Right.
Speaker 4
Oh, right, OK.
Speaker 2
Then you can have.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
But the other one you only. Have one so I. Don't know the technical or medical reason for it, but that's the maybe the dosage might be whatever it is.
Speaker 4
Yeah. No, I haven't picked up on that as well. OK, yeah.
Speaker 2
That's so that's the yeah. Sorry, but I interrupted. Please go on. You were telling me about.
Speaker 4
No, that's all right. No, that's all right. Oh, yes. So the. So the Dara. So the Dara, Dara tummy map is in both then.
Speaker 3
The four of them, yeah.
Speaker 4
Then obviously the DTD is thalidomide.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So the drug.
Speaker 4
The V then the V is called VELCADE. The VSO VELCADE but the other word is called Jessamine.
Speaker 2
Is the one the V yes. Mail to you. OK, OK. Yeah. And that that one also has neuropathy. It also causes the.
Speaker 4
Yes, yes it does.
Speaker 2
Right. Right.
Speaker 4
Let me just double check. I've written all down the side effects. I know it's a lot. It's a lot to get your head around, isn't it?
Speaker 2
It is. It is a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, what they were trying to tell me is 2 of the dogs caught the two of the drugs caused neuropathy. And one of them is is Talia. And if, but if you have REVLIMID, it's less.
Speaker 4
That's what it seems to be.
Speaker 2
That's that's needed to.
Speaker 4
That's less, it's actually. Validate ride seems to have a higher. A less effect on your immune system than than than rivals than so that could make you more neutropenic you know more risk of.
Speaker 2
Revlimid, yeah.
Speaker 4
Sorry, less or more. I'm getting confused now. No less. Yeah. So the limit seems to have less, although it affects it. Obviously all is going to affect your bone. Marrow. It doesn't seem to be as potent in damaging all the cells. Revlimid does seem to have a a higher effect on, you know, bringing your bringing your white blood cells down your red.
Speaker 2
Right. For example the.
Speaker 4
Sales, that's what I can gather.
Speaker 2
Right. Right. OK, it sounds like.
Speaker 4
So it's kind of more dangerous in a way. The REVLIMID, whether that makes it more effective, I don't know, yeah.
Speaker 2
But it's more. It's more effective. It sounds. It sounds like you'll be more effective because what you're trying to do in the end is you're trying to get to the point where you have, you know, good on the four cycles you're trying to get to the point where you have good response and the level of white blood cells which are forming protein. Has really really gone down and then you go for the high dose? Team, but it sounds like with the with the Talino mind if you know, as opposed to realism age, you might end up having to do more doing that high dose key more than you might have to do if you're on REVLIMID, for example.
Speaker 4
Probably. Possibly, yeah.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 4
It kind of it kind of might suggests that it's difficult to say it's reading between the lines.
Speaker 2
It does because. If you could tell anything without being. A medical prac.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Well, I think you should have another appointment with him, actually.
Speaker 2
We have been.
Speaker 1
And discussing this again because.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, I have. Yeah. I have the appointment on Thursday, some meeting with them on Thursday. I mean Thursday.
Speaker 4
You've got so many questions.
Speaker 3
Yeah, OK. I mean to be to be.
Speaker 2
Honest, this is me trying to just. And yeah. The situation, because I've already decided and we've gotten approval for DTVLA because I think that David, while it may be possible or not to get the approval from AXA to go ahead with it, it sounds like it will be a long protracted process. And I'm not, I'm just not willing to go through a long.
Speaker 4
No, no, that's get started, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, exactly. I just want to get started and get on with it. So. So. So I've decided to just go for the DTV. Just I was just thinking I would prepare myself for in terms of side effects.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I think, yeah. And I think the differences are quite minimal, yeah.
Speaker 2
That's all, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I mean we've I think it's just being more aware of the peripheral neuropathy, you know, and knowing if it is or not. And then they can tweak the dosages. They can't tweak the dosage of all of them. I don't think that they can tweak the dosage of some so.
Speaker 2
Alright, OK, OK, got you.
Speaker 4
I think it's just, you know, you're a very intelligent person. You will definitely be on the ball with, you know, giving them a very accurate description of how you're feeling, which is quite important just to look out for.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. OK.
Speaker 3
UM.
Speaker 4
I mean, there's things you know the peripheral neuropathy is a very annoying one because we can't seem to find, you know, an antidote to give just to correct it. It's got to be your own nerve system that corrects itself. Really. Eventually. There's things such as having, you know, eating out of the B vitamins. I think I've sent something over to you. That's.
Speaker 2
Right, right.
Speaker 4
Something that's suggested because we need our B vitamins to repair the growth of nerves, and that's effectively what's happening, is damaging the nerve ending.
Speaker 2
Right. So you think vitamins? Well, the things I asked my doctor about about vitamins in general. I didn't speak specifically about vitamins in general and he was he was quite against any kind of vitamin.
Speaker 4
But we're not taking supplements. Yes. Sorry. I don't mean about taking supplements. No, just making sure you've got that in your diet, basically.
Speaker 2
OK, OK. I would be good to know what kind of things I can pretend to know what kind of.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah, they're very. I think I might have sent you, I think. It seems like I think I've sent you in your. I'm just gonna have a quick look. If I put it in your resources, stuff that I've put it or not. If not, I will send it over to you.
Speaker 3
Or did you send me someone?
Speaker 2
Yeah, please. And.
Speaker 4
Yeah, there is. If you can look on your, I'll put it in the chat as well. Yeah, I'll look into that.
Speaker 2
Yeah, in the chat, yeah. Oh, it's not in the tattoo. Sorry I haven't looked anything else. I've only been looking.
Speaker 4
At it. That. That's OK. I think I sent it last week. So it's called managing peripheral neuropathy and myeloma.
Speaker 2
I think. OK, I'll have a look. OK.
Speaker 4
At that, you know, it's kind of you can try to do really, but have trying to. I'll send you a list about what to say about the the sort of foods I've got the B vitamins in. I mean it's.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 4
Eggs, red meat, dairy products, that sort of thing. Probably stuff that's in your. That already. But you know when you're having treatment, you sometimes.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 4
Go off food, so if you can just try and make sure you do include some of that, then at least you're getting you know you're. Still getting it, yeah.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 4
So I will. Have a look at what I've sent and I'll make. Sure that you've.
Speaker 3
Got that list as well. Thank you. Yeah. OK, so well.
Speaker 4
And then it start managing it, like keeping the area as warm as possible. You know, trying to keep make sure the blood flow is still, it's your hands and feet that mainly get affect. So, you know, making sure trying to keep your feet warm and things even sometimes that massaging cream into your feet, put socks on for bed, that sort of thing can help because it just keeps the blood flow getting to the nerve ending.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 2
I guess the thing as well, I mean that's the one I've been focused on because that's the one that. That's the only one that my. My haematologist, Dr Ivanov seems to be concerned about. I guess one question for me. Is are there. Others because when I read because obviously doing all this because of this licencing thing, I've had to look up each one of those and in looking up the drugs I see lots of long list.
Speaker 4
I know.
Speaker 2
Scary list actually.
Speaker 4
It was scary.
Speaker 2
I guess what else is there that's significant that I should be thinking about? The other one he's telling me.
Speaker 4
Very difficult.
Speaker 2
Or is it just individually? Is your based on individual?
Speaker 4
It does make. It difficult because yes, everyone reacts differently, which is very annoying. You can't give you a, you know, A1 list that's you know. So this is exactly what happen exactly I mean. The drugs will, sort of. They tend to upset the digestive system a bit generally, so some people might find they feel a bit nauseous, but obviously we can have tablets to help with that. Some people might find maybe they get a bit constipated, so again it's things like, you know, having plenty of fluids still trying to do a little bit of exercise moving around, you know, eating fibre and taking some laxatives. But then some people find they actually might have loose stools. So. It's really, really difficult.
Speaker
Oh really?
Speaker 4
Before you go in there. Basically it upsets your system so so everyone will respond slightly differently to to how.
Speaker 3
It reacts to that. I think the most.
Speaker 4
OK, that is because the drugs are there to destroy those bad cells. Your body then try to regenerate. So naturally, you're going to feel tired. And that's basically because, you know your body is working like a machine. Trying to. To recover. Yeah. So it's about balancing.
Speaker 2
There's a lot of fatigue.
Speaker 4
Energy as much as anything, and the children sort of made me. But again, like you might not find it very much, but try and have a rest in the middle of the day or something just to regenerate yourself with your body time. You know to replenish and and don't push yourself too hard, sort of thing. Otherwise you'll feel it the next day.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 2
Right, right. Got you. Got you. OK. OK. Well, that's that's that's good to know and kind of you know, I'll bear that in mind. We're hopefully. I think the week of the 11th.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
So that's where we should start. I think it's going to be two visits per week to the hospital and then it's going to be the tablets for the other side. They're going to give me, he's going to give me. I mean, I think the details are there, but they're going to drive it in a bit more detail to me on Thursday when I meet with them. And then I have to sign. A little documentation. Yeah, I guess. Waivers and stuff. So say.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I was reading through some of the literatures you've been given, and I think there might be. You might not have.
Speaker 2
That's kind of weird. I lost you for a second next season. What did you say?
Speaker 4
Sorry, I was looking through. I'll move to a different room it. Might be the signal. I was looking through the the literature that you know that you've been sent with your protocol and I just wondered, there's quite a few words on there that you might not have understood or you may have googled them and have covered all that but.
Speaker 2
I haven't. I haven't googled.
Speaker 4
Yeah, no.
Speaker 2
Have have been quite focused on some things and other things. I've just kind of gloss over. I think the key thing I was trying to understand was what are the names of the drugs and what's the, you know? The kind of. The routine I'm going to be taking them. On and so that's. That's that's the majority of what my focus has been. And then I wanted to understand there's something around the bone. It's a bone supplement of. Repaired drug that I'm going to be taking, but I need to see the dentist first before I. Yeah. Yeah. Get that booked. Yeah. So some of the other details I haven't really.
Speaker 4
OK. Oh yeah, yeah. I buy phosphonate. Yeah. So just. Yeah. No, it's very it's very in depth.
Speaker 2
Is there if the stuff you think I should know and you want to draw my attention to, please, please draw my because at the moment there's a whole raft of stuff I'm dealing with that might mess up.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah, I'm sure, yeah. OK, well, there was a couple. I mean I can again, I can put this in the chat if it's easier, I could probably I just made a few little notes, so I could always just put those in and then put, you know sort of definition next to them just in case you wonder when you come across them.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that would be helpful. Yes. Please be very good. And you sent me some links. I mean I I saw the last one you sent, I did try to go to the link but but the link seems to be it's a generic link on that.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 2
Website So it doesn't link directly to the article you were talking about and I've been on that website so I don't know. I haven't read it. I definitely haven't read the article, so I would be keen to see that article. So maybe if you just have the very Last Post yet if you just returned to the actual article because I tried looking for, I couldn't find it.
Speaker 4
Oh, OK.
Speaker 1
OK.
Speaker 4
OK, I'll try and send that friend. Yeah.
Speaker 2
That would be useful, but I think I think this is probably like a key. A key, you know, key part of the whole thing.
Speaker 4
I might. Right. OK. I'll try and resend. I might not have copy and paste the whole title of it. I might have only first half. Maybe. Yeah. I'll try and resend that. OK, now I meant to ask you, have you? How was your chest? Have you had any sort of? I didn't ask you if you had any past medical history of asthma or anything like that, diabetes or anything else.
Speaker 3
OK, OK.
Speaker 2
No, I haven't got, so I don't have asthma. I don't. I'm not diabetic either.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 2
Might just. Yeah. Typically. OK, I don't typically have chest infections or anything other than maybe 2 bouts of COVID, which I've had, which, you know, it does what it does. Other than that, I haven't, I haven't. Yeah, I don't have a history of any kind of chest pains or problems. Yeah.
Speaker 4
OK, that's good. Yeah. No, no, that's good. That's lovely. Because one thing is one of the things that gives you the IT says something. It says PCP prophylaxis and it's sort of that basically means Pneumocystis pneumonia. So you might get antibiotics.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 4
To cover to make sure you don't get chest infections at.
Speaker 2
I see. OK, I see. I see.
Speaker 4
But they would give you that anyway.
Speaker 2
They would and is that as part of the whole thing, or is that when my immunity starts to drop? Because I presume as I go through the four courses as against maybe cost three and four, my immunity will be quite low, I would imagine because yeah, obviously killing off all the white blood cells.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be at that point. Yeah. Wouldn't you would have them all the time. It would only be when they feel that you.
Speaker 2
OK, from the beginning, OK.
Speaker 4
Might be at risk of.
Speaker 2
That that you'd have that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then there might be some points I need to start avoiding kind of. Big crowds and big locations. I mean, I don't know whether that's the thing or not, but I just assumed that might be the case.
Speaker 4
It is. And that was, yeah, definitely again I think. That's definitely a question to. Ask what? What sort of how many days. Into treatment or. How many you know, weeks into treatment even will your white cells start to drop? Because until they start dropping, you're fine. It's and as you. Have probably know. They will be taking blood from you quite frequently, so soon as they start seeing them drop in then they will say, right? You know this when you got to be careful.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I need to not quite isolate, but I need to. Yeah, maybe avoid the subway.
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, and things like, yeah, lots of cleaner areas. Where you're maybe even in a lot of cafe where you're all, you know, lots of people together or something, but just outside, the fresh air is obviously fine.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 4
It's just it's. Like the COVID rules, really. You know, so.
Speaker 2
Right, right. Right. In a sense, just to try and avoid any kind of infections, just from, yeah, people around. Yeah. Yeah, got it. Got it. So I'll definitely have that.
Speaker 4
Why? Because I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. They might give you a little book. We used to give our patients little red book and write down their blood results in them. But you know. Not to sort of have to be meticulously looking all the time, but sometimes it's good for you to have a little. A bit of an idea to know what your you know what your blood sugars start with. For example, what your haemoglobin is and what your white cell count.
Speaker 2
OK. That's a good idea. Actually, that's a good idea, because that's that's. I mean, that was the conversation we had and the trending we did to decide to start the treatment anyway. So I think that's a good idea because basically we got all the results of the last two years at the Bloods and we just looked at them and they just did a quick.
Speaker 4
Is what you.
Speaker 2
To see how it was trending, and it was based on that we said, well, you know at this rate you know it's you know you know globally you become quite anaemic and stuff by the next few months. So therefore we need to act so. So I guess that's that's the key thing.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah. That yeah, I mean, it's quite you're quite interested in this.
Speaker
Thank you.
Speaker 4
I think it is quite interesting to see you know. For example, how quickly your haemoglobin might drop, but. When it comes back up again or you know just it's quite interesting to see.
Speaker 2
A trend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'll definitely. I think it's a good idea whether they give me a book or not. I think I might I. Might get one. Myself, I just because if they give me. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. If they give me the results because they normally copy me on the.
Speaker 4
Yeah, this is sorry or something.
Speaker 2
Results and I can. I kind of. I mean, it's been 2 years now, so I think I know what I'm looking for. I know some of the key numbers I watch out for the power for things. And and all that. So I think I know what I'm looking for so I can start to chat some of those and log them every time I get them on a weekly or fortnightly basis depending on the number of times I do. But so yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, I might feel a bit more tired.
Speaker 2
That's a good shot. Good shot.
Speaker 4
You know, maybe our tiny little bit more red meat or a bit more, you know, nuts or whatever is going to help with your eye and a bit more. Spinach. You know that sort of. Thing it does help your diet can help with those sort of things.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
OK, OK.
Speaker 2
That's that's good. That's good to think about. I am even at the moment, I do feel. I mean it's it's started over the last maybe couple of weeks kind of joint pain and I don't know whether there's anything to do with anything. But I do see you a bit of joint pain, I'm going to speak to my when I speak to my colleagues on Friday, I'm going to basically mention it to.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, you haven't had any. They haven't given you any sort of medication at the moment?
Speaker 2
No, no, nothing. I would say having anything.
Speaker 4
No, no.
Speaker 2
No. Yes.
Speaker 4
Yeah, OK. Yeah. So keep an eye on that. Just see, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, I'll speak to him about this. And if we think if we need to do any tests or anything. Let me know because. The last pet CT they did was quite clear. So yeah, so. Well, I'll let you know whatever. He comes back with. On Thursday, it can be Thursday next week. I'll let you know. Whatever. You know, we agree. And as I did, you know, if anything changes from the protocol and.
Speaker 4
OK. Yes, please. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Stuff that.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah. Thank you. No, that'll be really helpful. Yeah. And how's work going? Are you managing to get things tied up like you wanted to?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I am. I am. Seriously. Yes, I am. I'm stepping through that at the moment. So I expect to to go by the end of the month like I said, so I will be kind of stopping work at the end of the month and I'll have a bit of a few, a few months maybe about six months off to just kind of get this over and done with.
Speaker 3
So yeah, yeah.
Speaker 4
Now I can understand that you want to get it sorted in your head, though it's nothing worse than worrying about that. Whilst you have time to focus on your. Own health. So that's all.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I think, I don't think I'm in that space to do much work anyway.
Speaker 4
No, no, I'm sure it must be really hard to but easily hand things over to other people.
Speaker 2

Speaker 4
Good morning, (Patient Name). Thanks for calling back.
Speaker 3
Good morning. Happy Monday.
Speaker 4
Happy Monday. To you. I just called you Friday on the off chance I might catch you, but yeah. How are things going? Have you had? A good summer.
Speaker 3
I think so, yeah. I think so. We just turn the radio. Down probably turn it off.
Speaker
And for.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, you've had a good summer.
Speaker 4
Jose, who spoke to.
Speaker 3
Definitely give my.
Speaker 4
Sorry, carry on.
Speaker 3
I was just saying. Just getting my head around still. What happened as it were something, at least in this context, I'm. Still getting. Some perspective on where I was as opposed to. Where I am, but I guess having an understanding about where I was gives me some idea about where. I am.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah. How so, obviously. You know, the trials were finished. And are you having any treatment at the moment?
Speaker 3
Trials not entirely finished. The drugs are finished. I'm still going in and I will be.
Speaker 4
OK, right. Yep.
Speaker 3
For the next. Seven years or something, and we will still be going in and giving Bloods. Periodically, at the moment it's every three months and it will go back eventually to six month.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 3
And then. Possibly once a year or something like that. So I guess I'm now in a watch and wait state. Yeah, and my biopsies and everything else all came back clear so that the hard bit is just me rehabbing. I just.
Speaker 4
Sometimes better.
Speaker 3
Have to.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Me to a state where I can navigate the world in a way that I feel is is is me, I.
Speaker 4
Guess. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. That all this heavy. Burden on your shoulders that you've been carrying around.
Speaker 3
But it's difficult to put it into words. Yeah, but so yesterday I took my son off for a place about 20 minutes. Drive away. It's got a bike, track, pump, track of what's called, which is a little. Kind of like. A A BMX course of some sort. And then there's a few trails that go through the forest. Great fun and for a six year old who's really kind of getting to own himself on a bike, owned his body and owned his bike and owned the movement and everything else, he's really enjoying it. He really loved it, so it was an easy sell and he stayed there. We stayed here probably longer than I should have because I started running out of energy and then about 3:00, we were driving. Back I fell asleep at the. Traffic light, which is not very yeah. I can't be doing that. When when I've got my son in the car.
Speaker 4
I love.
Speaker 3
I'm doing that anyway, but I'm doing that. So like, yeah, that was a wake up call. I know, I know. I'm tired, but try and put it into context for others around this.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I fall asleep at traffic lights.
Speaker 4
Well, at least you would have stopped and you knew that it. Was OK so so. It's obviously you close your eyes momentarily and then obviously.
Speaker 3
You don't even remember doing that. I. Was just sitting there like some. And then the next thing.
Speaker 4
Really. Wow.
Speaker 3
I go look. Hang on a minute. No, I didn't get a beep, but the. Cars in front had moved off and the current society had moved off because behind me obviously hadn't moved and and none of them have beeped me yet. But I I I guess. It would have been. Imminent, it was only. Momentary, but you only need the moment and.
Speaker 4
Yeah, it's a bit scary.
Speaker 3
Don't want to. Speak to you.
Speaker 4
I mean, it was a. Really hot day yesterday here. I don't know whether you had a very hot day as well.
Speaker 3
Similar similar. Yeah, yeah. Lovely day. Perfect day for you in the trees.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, it must have been lovely. Well, how long were you out for them, do you think?
Speaker 3
I think we got there. At about 11:30. UM. After about 3.
Speaker 4
3:00. All right, quite a long day then. Yeah. So like 3 or 4 hours. On the bikes. Not surprised you were tired.
Speaker 3
It wasn't just on like. Yeah, we stopped for lunch. And we take the blackberries and we.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 3
It's just exactly what Daddy wants to do. With a six. Year old boy.
Speaker 4
Yeah, well, that was really good. Few months ago when I spoke to you were made, you know, you wouldn't have had the energy to do any of that. So that's amazing.
Speaker 3
It would be very apprehensive. Yeah, yeah. Exercise. I try and go for a walk every day or. Every second day at.
Speaker 4
Least, yeah.
Speaker 3
And an hour's walk and I.
Speaker 1
OK.
Speaker 3
Everything and walk out the door. And go for a walk and.
Speaker 4
Oh brilliant, that's helping.
Speaker 3
That's critical. I think magnesium has a bearing on things. I mean, it's hard to know on. But I think the magnesium has some bearing on. In simplistic crude senses and managing one's nerves. Right. OK. OK. So anyway, I started taking magnesium vitamin D. And B complex as well. Yeah, right. And it's probably mostly the The Walking is helping but not written the magnesium as well, no.
Speaker 4
No, no, no, all good. It's good. I mean, it's, yeah, good idea because it's it's quite difficult to get magnesium in your food if your magnesium is low. Most people aren't running. I think, you know, at a low level of magnesium. But when you've been to all this, it's probably quite critical, as you say, so that's good. Plus A/B complex, yeah.
Speaker 3
My bloods don't say that it's low, but I don't know if the blood represents they're good. They're a single sample. They're not a kind of a representation of a point in time during a situation.
Speaker 4
Oh, OK.
Speaker 3
You've done X or Y or ZI don't entirely understand, but I do definitely get that the body is more complex than a single sample of.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what? Your body doesn't need it will just philtre out anyway. So that's yeah. Oh, OK, well, that's good. So do you have a? Magnesium clamped on its own? Or have you? Got a sort of multivitamin.
Speaker 3
It's magnesium tablets on its own IT 200. I can't remember.
Speaker 4
OK. Right. Yeah. And then vitamin D separately and then a B complex separately.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I started. Off with the very expensive B complex, the one that pregnant mothers often take. And then I found another one that's called stress B. OK. It kind of rang a tone when I read the bottles name. Oh, OK that kind of makes sense. Maybe it's got some slightly different things in it. Yeah.
Speaker 4
OK. Well, that's good. Yeah. No, no, that's good. So you had. A lovely holiday and and then (CST Staff Name) had said you were trying to get back to work. Is that right?
Speaker 3
That's right. No, this week is probably not going to happen because birthdays going on, we've got a few hospitals and I've got an appointment tomorrow. And then my mother-in-law is currently.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah.
Speaker 3
Going for eye surgery, she's getting me laser eye treatment in one eye, so that kind of just means a little bit more strain going on, so I probably won't be going to work.
Speaker 4
All right, yeah.
Speaker 3
This week, but I will try and do a morning or a trip in any way to say hello and start that. Of going just to see where things are. I don't expect it to amount to, you know, me being a nine to five guy in his short length of time.
Speaker 4
Right. OK.
Speaker 3
But I don't really want to start. Making friends and finding out what? The story is in.
Speaker 4
There. Yeah, yeah. Have you spoken to them yet about? Going back or?
Speaker 3
On and off. I haven't spoken to them early recently. Usually the conversation don't talk about going back. They're just sort of. Hello. How are you kind of thing and all the rest, which is nice. And that's not to have that as a. Pressure point no. It was a big it was a big group of them, came over from the US and some came from.
Speaker 4
All right.
Speaker 3
For kind of a team meeting or globally different teams, they all came over and I went out for dinner and then. Went out to what else was going on? There was some other thing I went to for the day at one point or not the day, but the the, the morning at one point and then bailed out at lunch time and I went for dinner the next day.
Speaker 4
Oh great. It was nice to. See everybody. So you touched base with a few. People. That's really nice, yeah. Do you feel a bit nervous about going back? Or are you looking forward to it?
Speaker
I was a.
Speaker 3
Lot more nervous when you're when you're on those drugs. Maybe it's different for everyone, but my experience is definitely a lot of brain fog that I didn't understand. So things made me anxious that I didn't need to be anxious about. Things, yeah. My nerves were shot.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Things were wrecking my head, as we might say. In Ireland, I don't know if that's a free.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. I think that comes into play quite a lot, really. So yeah, almost as much as the physical side of things. Yeah, but you're feeling that's obviously clearing a lot now.
Speaker 3
I've got a bit more metal I can say no and not be quite as emotionally wrenching.
Speaker 4
Hmm, OK.
Speaker 3
You know which. I'm I'm not good at saying no anyway. When you're. When you kind of have to own your own health a little bit and draw boundaries for your own well-being.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
That was probably the biggest bit was drawing the circle around. And it's not. A fixed circle either so.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
And now I have. A bit more ownership of my own ability to say where my boundaries are and.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 3
I find that. It's just easier to navigate everything.
Speaker 4
That's good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess it come. I think it comes from experience though, doesn't. It you have to always go through. You know, doing too much or saying yes the too many things to realise. Actually, no. When I say no, you know, it makes it better. If you need to get that.
Speaker 3
No, no, I'm going to ignore that.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 3
The whole one anyway.
Speaker 4
Yeah. So I don't know whether there's, I think what I'm trying to things we've mentioned to you before something called. Life after cancer, we mentioned that to you. Probably not.
Speaker 3
I don't remember it, but maybe.
Speaker 4
No, I can. No, we haven't yet because I think cause you're still going through all the treatment. It's a bit, you know, turning now at this point. There is a really good organisation, I'll put it in the chat. I'll send you a link called Life after cancer. And it is. Set up by a lady called Stephanie in London, who had been through a blood cancer herself, actually. And she felt that she, you know, had a really heavy time going through it. But coming to the end of treatment and coming out the other side, there was a very lack of support, you know, for especially for the younger side, younger generation and younger people still working and everything. So she actually set it up herself with other people who've been through similar experiences.
Speaker 3
Good for her.
Speaker 4
And and yeah, it's amazing. We've actually met her, but we framed. We had a meeting with her to sort of find out what they offer and what they do, and quite a lot of it is free as well, which is really good. There's a lot of online things that you can just join in and out of if you've got time and if you want to. But she's a lovely lady. And if you look at the website, I think she's she's on. She's actually in the pictures. They're real people. They're not. You know, they haven't got the. Word imposing, actually. The people of the planet. And they do have a coaching system, so she's taken on people and. They've got coaches. It's a very it. Seems a very nice organisation and quite a lot of our patients from reframe have actually gone through and really benefited, so might be working taking a look. As I say, I'll put it in your resources and I'll put it in your chat.
Speaker
Would you send on?
Speaker 3
Oh OK. I haven't signed into any of that. In a long time, I'll have to read password.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah, if you want. To or I mean I can. Send you an e-mail if that's easier for today.
Speaker 3
Send me an e-mail, but I should. I should sign in anyway because change would lose those things. My connection with you guys. Runs out after. That time doesn't it in like 2 years or? Something like that.
Speaker 4
Say we've got till the till December this year.
Speaker 3
Sales force pays for you by.
Speaker 4
Yeah. So I've got a few minutes left. Yeah. But yeah, I mean if the yeah. So the that's quite handy if you especially if you're going back to work, you might not read up on our phone call with us. So you can just send us a quick chat and (CST Staff Name) and I can just check in on chat which is much more convenient to you. We won't need to disturb you if. You're trying to work. Or anything. So yeah, I'll get. (CST Staff Name), to do that with you. So you can just. Reset your password, but I'll I'll get her to. Do you want me to give you a quick call in a few days or something and just? Set this up for you when you're ready.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, that would be very interested in that group. But what's the name of the group again?
Speaker 4
So the group is called life after cancer and you can just Google it yourself. It's all one word and it's and it's based in London, but they cover the whole because they're, you know, an online forum as well. They they have webinars, they have. You know, lots of the things that people face about going. Back to work. What is normal now you know the new normal or, you know, feeling tired. How you cope with cope with all the psychological issues. So yeah, it's. Actually it is good.
Speaker 3
OK, good.
Speaker 4
So that's a good one to good stepping stone. Really, I think as well.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I've been bumping into with the whole COVID thing. I really resisted going anywhere near any support groups, and I think that was a mistake of mine.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 3
Should have found if only other avenues of taking advantage of those types of. Things, even if it meant that I didn't go there in person or something like that. And then as I've come out, I've been talking to some other people who were very supportive during it. But then afterwards, after the treatment finished and I was a little bit more engaging, shall we say, yeah. They they were expect these other people, who I would have, I guess I would have gone into those experiences or those those conversations in the support group during the time. But they were saying how how it it takes some people depending on the cancer and all the rest of it. But it takes some people anything from a year to six years. To kind of. Go. Do you know what? I'm finished with that now, but I don't need. I'm not in that. Umbrella of exhaustion anymore and can now climb that hill, metaphorically or physically, and it doesn't impact me anymore, but it can take a while to. Shake it off.
Speaker 4
It's amazing, isn't it? It is a very long time to think about it. Yeah, well, it's a life changing event, isn't it? You've, you know, really crucial. Well, we have lots of, you know, thoughts about everything in life. And it's it, everything we experience and life changes a little bit. But when you've been through it that intensely, it's it's bound to have that after effects.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. If it wasn't for all the negative stuff, I'd recommend it to anyone.
Speaker 4
Good self finding is.
Speaker 3
That being said, I yeah, I don't know if it would have the value if it didn't have half the. Negative stuff. Like my little too old to come to say. Good morning. Hello, Elliot.
Speaker 4
Ohh Elliot. Oh, that's nice name. That's lovely. So what is the old one back at school? Today or not?
Speaker 3
Yes, yes, yes, it's been better back to school. Couple days now. Yeah. Yeah, he's enjoying it. I think seeing his studies. Senior infants.
Speaker 4
Senior. Infant. Ohh gosh. Wow big boy. Now then umm ohh wow.
Speaker 3
See the. Yeah. Yeah. She gets to walk past all the junior and looking all sad and flawed as they're going queuing up and he gets to walk in. I'm a big boy. I can. I can walk straight.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Oh, oh, that's nice. No. That's good. That's good. Oh well, if you need to. Go and sort out, Elliot, that's. I'll let you go, but yeah.
Speaker 3
No, my friends talk to him, right? Yeah. Is there anything else to cover or to chat chat about?
Speaker 4
Anyway, yeah. So so I was just checking in really. So no. So obviously your stuff in the blood test and things. So you're, are you on any medication apart from any of these supplements, you're not on anything, no maintenance treatment.
Speaker 3
No, I'm not. Or anything, just a matter of work. And of course, my health insurance company trying to figure out where I am in terms of how.
Speaker 4
Right now, OK.
Speaker 3
How quick I can they can get me off their books basically without them. I guess being mean and throwing me in. The deep end.
Speaker 4
Right. So so you. Yeah, I spoke to you.
Speaker 3
After their their their doctor's review. Of me, didn't I? I think I did. You might have.
Speaker 4
When was that quite recent, or was that?
Speaker 3
It was earlier in the summer. I was where I should be and to wait until September for any kind of sign of going back to work and then take it as it comes, go go for it to some degree, but be fully prepared. It would be too much.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 3
And then you know, scale back and. But at least have great. Time to work on and then. Maybe while later by some more and then really said work. That's fine. Just know that that's what it's going to be like.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 3
Don't hold yourself up with too many high expectations, but don't stop yourself from. Having a go either.
Speaker 4
Right, OK. Can you work from home fed or do you have to go?
Speaker 3
Into an office I can work from home. Right. Initial choice would be to go into the office a little bit at least for the human interaction and just and get some of that routines of of. Being spending at a volume of times doing work at the moment, I think if I was to try and work from home from cold, I hope just sitting there going. Yeah, right. I've got a 2 year old to go and play. With us and and go and get a.
Speaker 4
Yeah. True. And you're right. The social. Interaction is good. I mean I so. I was wondering when I said have you spoken to her whether you could do if? They've sorted out a phase return for you.
Speaker 3
That's what, that's. What the next conversations will be. Yeah, office is very much a work from home type of a company at this point. Some lots of companies have reverted back, but I think Salesforce's huge value in not spending money on real estate so.
Speaker 4
Do you have both levels to the office?
Speaker 3
No, it's about 40 minutes.
Speaker 4
40 minutes. OK OK. Yeah.
Speaker 3
Not the end of. The world most. Of it's by train and some 15 minute walk at the other end.
Speaker 4
All right. Right, OK. OK. With. Yeah, I mean, you're right. Go for it. I would say don't. Don't push yourself too much at the beginning. It's much better for. Different opinion, but if you if you sort of start slowly and build up sometimes that's. You know, if you, if you agree to maybe go back three days a week but shorter hours.
Speaker 3
Oh yeah, when I say go for it. I'm not talking about I do half days, 3 days of half days and just see where we were.
Speaker 4
Three days of half days, yeah.
Speaker 3
That's probably what I would do. The starting space just to get a gauge, you know, not go not five days a week, full time and then.
Speaker 4
Good. Yeah. No, you're worrying me then. No, no, that's nothing.
Speaker 3
And not even with any major sort of commitment to doing it the following week. Kind of just, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Play it hard. Yeah. See how.
Speaker 3
Have have three days where I'm going. Yeah. Putting my best foot forwards, but not.
Speaker 4
It goes.
Speaker 3
Yeah. If I decide that. Oh, do you know what? That Monday I actually want to. Do something different then, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. No, that's definitely the best. The best plan, I think. Yeah. Yeah. And don't time build it up. Too quickly, either stick at that for you know several weeks, I'd say because it it will exhaust you mentally and physically so.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And I and I kind of I kind of want to find out where that line is for that particular kind of activity with the traffic light yesterday at 3:00 in the afternoon. I don't expect it to be. Too far away and I need to be able to say. To myself and to to work as well, that's where the line. Yeah, it works up to that point. And then afterwards, I can't focus on the meeting anymore. So me being in it.
Speaker 4
Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. I mean, although the brain fog lifting you, you like, you know, the cognitive ability sometimes longer concentration time is is difficult. So as you know.
Speaker 3
Some some of that will just be because I haven't been immersed in that stuff for that long. So it'll be, you know, whole muscle that I have to reuse again and and some of it will be will be the the residual impact of cancer and treatment and things. So it'll be, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah. No, absolutely. OK, well, well. It's lovely to that. You're at this point. Really lovely that you. Know you're now. Sort of turning the corner and on the on the upward trend as it is, yeah. Thank. We are we good to get you set up with a chat as you say. So shall I? Do you want to call in when? It's a good time for you. Just to sort of have 5 or 10 minutes for (CST Staff Name). Just this little admin of it.
Speaker 1
Yeah, sure.
Speaker 4
Or would you like her to sort of touch base with you one day this week?
Speaker 3
UM. Tomorrow. Not a good day, but otherwise, yes. Give her. Let her give me a call when she has a free space. Because I'm talking to your client.
Speaker 4
OK, so you can just talk you through it. No, no, no, she's fine. She we love. We love to speak to you. So that that's great. And yeah, we'll get you set up and then you've got access support. Lovely. When you when you feel like it. Well, thanks so much for calling back, (Patient Name). Really lovely to hear you sound so well and.
Speaker 3
Thank you. Thank you for the encouragement.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I know it's been a long Rd.
Speaker 3
And thank you for your time referral. I really appreciate it. Yeah, there's been lots of. Well, I guess this is a service that you provide, but lots of little little points where people have sent messages from, often from people who are really wouldn't have expected it from and they've been little little glimmers, little Nuggets. But in hindsight I've I've really cherished or valued and appreciated.
Speaker 4
Well, that's good.
Speaker 3
Or it'll adds. It all does add up very much. I should have done. I should have done a a support group type thing. I really should have.
Speaker 4
You don't know. I mean, I think there were times you were so tired. That you were trying. To save your energy to spend time with your family, you know you didn't want, you know, in a sense, you have the focus and energy to give to even listening to other people it might, you know, it might be that now is the time to think about that.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe I can give back to somebody else as well. I think the next the next person's. Trip had already experienced a little bit easier.
Speaker 4
Yeah. No, that's a really good thing too. Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Yeah. But, you know, you still need a you still. Need a bit. Of support, as you said, you'll you know you have found the corner sort of thing, but it's still getting back on the path, the normality, which is it isn't easy. You know, some people find it easier than others, I think. But you're a very deep thinker and I think, you know, you'll think a lot about it, more than some people who just sort of jump back on and shut the door to what's happened before.
Speaker 3
Gosh, I envy them a little.
Speaker 4
Whether they really do those question, we don't know the well, they just don't vocalise it hard to tell. Yeah, but OK, well, yeah, I'll thank you. I will send you an e-mail now with that reminder just in case and and have another look for maybe another more specific support group as well, which might be helpful.
Speaker 3
OK, yeah. Yes, good idea.
Speaker 4
Brilliant. Well, have a lovely day. First. Enjoy the nice weather and dump pipe with Elliot.
Speaker 3
OK. OK, OK dokie. Enjoy your sunny day. Take it easy.
Speaker 4
Look, thank you too. Thanks for calling. Take care.
Speaker 3
Happy Monday. Bye.
Speaker 4
And you too.

Speaker 3
We've called reframe Cancer Support without speaking magic and English.
Speaker 2
Hi. Thanks, (patient name).
Speaker 3
Oh, hi. Hello. How can I help you?
Speaker 2
I think he's got today and he said probably market, very rare, some support. OK, obviously. This is this is this is the cancer line, isn't it?
Speaker 3
It is, yes, it's three friends.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So I had cancelled last year, so I had. Therapies and 30 radio therapies which ended the end of the year. From a neck, throat and tongue. That's the area that they targeted. Still programme.
Speaker 3
Sorry to hear that you're looking for this.
Speaker 2
That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. I'm. I'm not under any treatment. And I have been given. You clear last month I still have a dry mouth and I still can't taste anything so, but obviously you look at the positive, not the negatives. And I've been to her doctor's facility. I've got viral infections is affecting my throat, was concerned about. But I tried to explain to my clinic overwhelmed at the moment. I figured what lack of enthusiasm respond them. I'm a bit angry at times, more than normal.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
To be honest, with this one, sort of like young self, why not really have anything to do with? Anybody. And I'm just think I'm just struggling to sort of like. To perform the normal acts in life, like in house, clean. So he thought me thought maybe better if I could get some support from some or maybe talk about some sorting.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Is it OK if I ask you who you working for? My lovely. The name of the company that you work for.
Speaker 2
Raw mail distribution.
Speaker 3
Going on now. Thank you. So, so yes, absolutely. So you're entitled to have what we call reframe access, and this is more practical and emotional support. So we can. We can answer some questions or point you into the right direction from from. What I heard. You definitely might, you know, benefit from some some counselling or some emotional support from professionals. Have you tried? And so I can I can send you. A charity lean. So they're. They're caught. Macmillan. I don't know if you've heard of them.
Speaker 2
When, obviously, when I was under the I was under, I am still under the Cancer Centre, Brighton and I was in, I am. I am part of Macmillan and obviously when I was under a treatment I did have a psychologist for about 8 weeks.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
I sat down with once a week or then come every two weeks when she fell. So I I have been through McMillan before, but I'm not. I just said to the doctor. But probably Iceland under the under the cancer doctor consultant Dr Brighton, you know whether it was better to ring you because obviously it's my words or to contact Macmillan. And obviously I don't know how. It's only when you ring on Miller, miss, just the help desk of the volunteers. I don't know how they get. To say the psychologists. Are in short supply and there's a lot of people on the table.
Speaker 3
Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing that I can I can send you. We do have some resources in regards with life after cancer because being, you know, dealing with with patients with cancer, we know that once you get the all clear it doesn't mean everything is finished and the patient. Being left with, you know. So some side effects from the chemo still and trying to get the life back because nothing seems to be seems to be like you know before. So I can send you some information about that I can actually I think we we do have recorded work. So if you want me to send send back, you might get information and. Some tips on how to cope with that emotionally.
Speaker 2
OK, that's fine.
Speaker 3
Yes. And also I will have a look if you're entitled to have what's called from work, it's called help at hand. Have you heard about it?
Speaker 2
Is it seems of feeling first class.
Speaker 3
So this is something. This is something from yonim, so I will need to check. I will need to check if your company has signed up to it, but they do have a lot of you know they do have counselling for free in their results counselling sessions so I will. I will look into that and send you. Send you an answer and and see if your company registered for that.
Speaker 2
I don't know, so I wouldn't know if they all.
Speaker 3
Said no. Yeah, I can. I can check. So don't worry. I will check for you. And let you know. And also give you. If they did. Then I'm. I'm just going to give you, you know, some how to how to register and what to do and what they offer.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fine. That'd be great. Anything really that can help?
Speaker 3
Bless you. Do you have do. You have anyone at home? For any support.
Speaker 2
I've got a son. He's got mental health problems at the moment and he's dealing with his own thing, so I can't really, to be fair, I can't really count on him. He's he's got his own, you know, he's dealing with his own problems. MHM, all this. Yeah.
Speaker 3
And how how has work been have they been? Supportive have you managed to get these so often?
Speaker 2
Been really, really good. I've been referred to the OHS twice. Just ups, so I do four nights. Six hours of the night with whatever driving I can do before I come home fire. So to be fair, they've been really, really, really helpful, really supportive.
Speaker 3
That's really good.
Speaker 2
And my line manager. Sometimes it's you can see how tired and I'll just sit in the chair. It's difficult thing because I'm sorry, new leaders made as a driver, but it understands you can't send me out.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. That this might be. Still, the long term effects of chemo. So I will, I will ask the input of one of our nurses as well, if that's OK. You know, just for a. Little bit of. Reassurance on you know the the. Effects of the chemo and. For how long? And if there are? Long term then, yeah. You know, just to put. Your mind at ease a little bit.
Speaker 2
OK. Thank you. Do you need any leverage this?
Speaker 3
Yes, please can I have an e-mail address? Yes.
Speaker 2
It's all lowercase. It's (patient email).
Speaker 3
Ok@yahoo.com. OK. Thank you.
Speaker 2
I saw a lot of lot of friends.
Speaker 3
Thank you. Yeah, got that. And is this the best number? For you.
Speaker 2
Yeah, this is your number on the contacts belong here.
Speaker 3
Lovely. Yes. OK. And is it OK just to ask you what kind of chemo if you know what kind of chemo drug have you had just because it would be, you know, easier for the nurse to to see exactly what are the side? Effects and for how long?
Speaker 2
Or the cancel the cancel was in the nose of my neck in my throat and the base of my tongue. OK. That's the cancer that they treated and it wasn't anywhere else in my body.
Speaker 3
OK. And do you know the name of the drug?
Speaker 2
No, not off hand. No, I didn't. I've never. I've never known the name of the of the chemo drug. No, I know everyone has different chemo drugs.
Speaker 3
OK. And for how long? Have you had the treatment?
Speaker 2
I had five chemotherapies that ended. In December 22 and I have 30, right? So basically my treatment started around the 20th of November I think. Maybe a bit before that 20th of November, but it was. Five Mondays in a row. My last chemo, sorry, my last radiotherapy was the 31st of December last year and I had I had thirty of those 55 boys.
Speaker 3
Ohh bless you, OK.
Speaker 2
Yeah, the doctor said it was pretty brutal, but that's not diagnosed as being the best option.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. No wonder maybe that, you know, you still feel the side effects from that because they can cause fatigue and tiredness and obviously.
Speaker 2
If I try and cut one of the lawns at home then it rains 2 days. Fine then. So by some I've done my fourth night of the week. I'm wrong, absolutely shattered.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Bless you. Yeah, I know you probably hear this a lot, but take it easy. Try and listen to your body and you know, just just take it easy. And do what you can.
Speaker 2
Yeah, the problem mine is because we're not obviously when after the first week of basically came home later. And then my mouth basically repelled everything that you put in it because it didn't taste it. So even though everyone says we used to have to eat pretend, what you're eating, it's tasteless. But you've got to eat it because that's what. Keeps you really going? I lost lots and lots of weight and I wasn't a big person, but I lost about 22 kilos. And then they put, they put me on a grip. I think I. I would feed myself on chew, went up my nose into my strength, my stomach.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
I would feed those nutrition drinks straight in. That's obviously I was only doing two or three a day, which wasn't helping and they managed. To get me up to six. But it was difficult because you have to. Syringe them in and I didn't have. A lot of strength to give us syringe.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, but how? How is it now? Do you? Do you have your taste back?
Speaker 2
No, it's got no taste back. Occasionally taste the odd thing. On the mouthfuls. And then? I'll easily raise the ties. Account to the recording to the test accounts has gone so positive.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Have you had a chat with your oncologist about, you know, the tasks? And do you have lots of appetite as well?
Speaker 2
I've got a meeting with him. Hopefully I'm with him for the next 4 or half years According to him and the check up is every three months which? My records are correct. It should be towards the end of December. Sorry end of September this month or the beginning of October is when I'm going to seeing next. And we don't see in the hospital.
Speaker 3
OK, OK. You might you might you might be worth, you know, mentioning that to see if you've got any options to improve?
Speaker 2
Yes, two fairies. He was the one that did my biopsy operation, and I've done my throat. He was the one that done. It and.
Speaker 3
That's good.
Speaker 2
We have facing him.
Speaker 1
That's very good.
Speaker 3
That makes the difference, isn't it?
Speaker 2
Well, yeah. Yeah. My ladies sold before that was really good as well. Obviously, I did a course for Macmillan called the Hope Corp. Where you especially place for 12 and we we got down to a ******** eight people. And we're on a WhatsApp group and quite here. Then you know it's all different. Came to it was. And it opens your eyes up to other people's cancer.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
They're like the ladies, obviously. Five of the women, different ages or their breast cancer and obviously. It's an eye opener and lung cancer. One guy tasked with council, so it does give you an understanding of what these other people? Yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They they are like. Support groups out there as. Well, not necessarily from Macmillan. And they're, you know, different charities. They're running support.
Speaker
Right.
Speaker 3
They they, most of them, they change their practise and they're doing it online now, but I'm I'm sure they they do some face to face Sessions as well. Would you like me to look into one of that around your area?
Speaker 2
Yes, great. Yeah, I'm quite happy to have cancelled over the phone since I've heard that before. I found it quite quite helpful before.
Speaker 3
Yes, yes. Can I just have the first or can I have either the area that you live in or the first line of your postcode?
Speaker 2
Please. Yeah, that's fine. I live in Brighton, BBN.
Speaker 3
OK. Thank you. Thank you. I will do some.
Speaker 1
Research and send you.
Speaker 3
To see what support groups are out there.
Speaker 1
OK.
Speaker 3
And send you sometimes. This is really good. Like you said, it's just. An eye opener and. You know, makes. You make the situation not better, but you know a little bit easier to navigate.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fine. That's not a problem. That's great, you know, to be honest. Any help?
Speaker 3
Bless you, of course, of course. So leave it with me. I will do all this research and probably I will send you the e-mail tomorrow. Is that? OK.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fine. I'll be. I'll be. I'll be going to work tonight and. Then I'll have look look tomorrow.

Speaker 1
Welcome to refrain. All calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. Once you've been connected to a member of our. Team, we may. Ask for information to help us verify your identity.
Speaker 2
Good afternoon. You're speaking to (CST Staff Name), can I say?
Speaker 1
Your name please.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Hello, Jodie. My name is (Patient Name).
Speaker 2
(Patient Name) (Patient Name). What's that? Yes.
Speaker 1
Yeah. Hi, (Patient Name). How can I help you today?
Speaker 3
Yeah, I would. You can. I I think she's someone to talk to. Really. Yeah. It's just I got diagnosed a few months ago with prostate cancer, and I just had a. An operation for it which which has gone. I think you know, got gone, OK and so on.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 3
But I guess what I'm struggling with at the moment is that it will require you literally in a couple of weeks time which.
Speaker 2
Oh, (Patient Name), I'm really sorry. It's just it's quite quiet. Is there any chance? Of you being. A bit louder or it? I don't know. It sounds like you're far away from your.
Speaker 3
Yes. Does that does that help ensure?
Speaker 2
That is a lot better. Thank you, (Patient Name). I'm really sorry. Could you just repeat that last minute? Obviously heard that you said you've had your surgery, what was?
Speaker 3
Our website. Yeah, of course, yeah. After that, yes the the the bit I'm sort of struggling to come to terms with is the fact that I'm retiring in a in a couple of weeks time. Literally, yeah. Because you know, six months ago, I went to my employer before I knew anything about my diagnosis or anything. And I thought I was doing them a real. Favour by saying. You know, I'm going to be with, you know, my intention is to stop work full time at the end of September, but would really like to. Would really like to carry on working for six months on a part time basis just to ease me into retirement and that's sort of the kind of stuff we do. You know that we do at work and and literally about a month after that. I got diagnosed with prostate cancer and I had the I had the offer a couple of weeks ago and I'm still sort of waiting for the obviously the Histology reports and so on. But I mean, hopefully it's gonna be. OK. But I think it's just I I guess I'm the combination of. Having the Canton retiring.
Speaker 2
A lot. That's. A that's a big life changing thing.
Speaker 3
Yeah, there's a lot going on and I wanted to use these last these for previous six months to come to, you know to get a few plans in place just to start thinking about retiring, which which we do. But that's been sort of knocked on the head of it by.
Speaker 2
Altogether, isn't it?
Speaker 3
The the the diagnosis I got about a month after that decision was made and I guess I don't know. And I know you don't have the you don't have the answers, but I'm in danger of getting a little bit bitter about about things because there's been no concession to. Working on a. Reduced hours spaces as requested and and it's it's very much right here. This is the way you're leaving. You know you're in the system. Make sure you hand in all of your stuff, you know. And I've been there a few years. I'm well. I'd like to think you know you're well liked and well respected and be able with a loss. And I'll just mentally.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
Do not feel prepared at all for. You know, that's sort of Cliff edge as it will be now of you know.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah.
Speaker 3
And the ironic thing is my employer is a leading. You know, you've heard of them. They're the leading employer, employee benefits provider who actually partner with with reframing. Offering it to all of its customers and. You know, feeling upfront about you. Know workers with question, flexible working hours and. All the stuff that they do for employees and. Yeah, yeah, this is probably not even the cancer related thing. It's just a combination of the two. I'm not. I'm not overly worried about the cancer, but it's just it's a little bit unknown at the moment and that would lend further. Appreciation from my point of view, if, as they had done to other employees, they'd consider, you know, a just a winding down as I originally requested six months ago, you know and for me.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
I feel I'm doing. Them a big favour or did six I could, I could have said. Yeah, he gives them a couple of months notice and I feel as if I've really shot myself in the foot by trying to help them out by saying, look, I'm going to go in six months full time, you know, hope this gives you time to find. Everybody's anything, but that's just how I'm feeling and.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
And I know there's no magical. Answer to it and I. You know, although it's just difficult to come to terms with things and make. At the moment.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So are you saying, then that they're not offering that wine down now? They're not saying you.
Speaker 3
Absolutely not. Not not.
Speaker 2
Can go in the park 10 hours. Oh, OK. Did they give you a? Reason for that?
Speaker 3
On the other, they found more. Sorry, I'm working. They've been very good in terms of, you know, well not very good you would expect. Yeah, after my. Operation, which was got three weeks ago to the day pretty much, you know, I had two weeks when I didn't do anything and I'm sort of coming back to work on a phased basis and then full time next week. But I've only got two more weeks of full time. So before I go, there's a there's a, there's a Cliff edge. So they haven't. There's been, no.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 3
You know, despite the fact. Me saying you know, as per my original request, I'd really be interested in just working, even if it's two or three months, just to help me. You know, there's that sort of comfort blanket, I guess, and familiarity, what at least while I know what the outcome is of my operation, you know?
Speaker 2
Yeah, because obviously you, you obviously don't know what the results are and we're obviously hoping. That they're positive, but.
Speaker 3
And I'm not optimistic. I'm not. I'm not. You know, I'm not. Thinking the worst, I've got no reason to expect now. I think you know these these operations are. He was in in fantastic hands with the NHS and I've got no reason to. And you know, it's been, you know, it's been quite early and and so on, I've got no, I've got no reason to overly worry about what this, what the future. Yeah. What the future in that respect might be. It's just it's just too much to sort of consider at once if that.
Speaker 2
Yeah, no, of.
Speaker 3
That most semi private sensor tool.
Speaker 2
Course like it does make perfect sense, (Patient Name), so. May I ask who your employer? Is if you don't mind sharing it.
Speaker 3
Yeah. It's, it's you, then you then.
Speaker 2
It is.
Speaker 3
You then yeah. So, you know, strong advocates, public clears, you know, offering flexible work into their. Employees and so on. And obviously we're the support infrastructure that you'd expect from them. And I just feel I've been. I've I've been let down a bit, I.
Speaker 2
Suppose, hmm. How long have you worked for them?
Speaker 3
About six years now.
Speaker 2
Were you in the claims department or it or?
Speaker 3
No, I mean this sort of risk risk area.
Speaker 2
Yeah. OK.
Speaker 3
So yeah, yeah, just see, you know. Yeah, we. You know, we we look at all of these, what we do, yeah, lots of different things. But a lot of it is. And supporting their product development, you know of adding reframe to all of our. You know products and so on to support other companies employees. You know all all that kind of thing. So it's it's something that you would think we you'd like to think yeah given given all of our publicity and yeah that we'd be quite tuned into you know that I just feel when it's come down to it it's.
Speaker
See you next.
Speaker 2
Yeah, of course.
Speaker 3
You know, it hasn't really. You know, has it helped me personally? And maybe you know, I don't, maybe it's the best thing. Maybe I just need to leave and leave that sort of comfort blanket. But it doesn't feel that way right now.
Speaker 2
No, and if that's how you're feeling you, it's it's difficult to know how you're going to feel in two weeks or in in two months. You just don't.
Speaker 3
Yeah, post the post. The actual, you know, at the end of October, I think I'm going to be told, you know, either it's been a, you know, you're in all all clear and come back in three months or 6. Time for. Blood tests just to keep, you know, make sure you're OK or you know you're going to need at some stage in the future. Some more treatment. You know that that will be what I'm facing at the end of. October it will just. It would just help. The way I'm feeling it, which is it's it's it's too much to stop on October the 1st and. Without having had that opportunity to focus over the last six months or OK, here's some of the things I'm looking to do or maybe I'm going to get a part time job, you know, outside, you know, just for a couple of days a week. But I haven't been able to do that because. You know, one month after made that fateful decision, I got diagnosed with this cat.
Speaker 2
So you've not even been able to look at alternative options, if that's.
Speaker 3
Not, not really. Not with any sort of, not with any certainty. You know, you you think about things, but you can't. You can't sort of action. And while I've got this sort of hanging.
Speaker 2
What you wanted to do?
Speaker 3
Over me, I suppose.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, of course. And so financially, you're OK. You know, if you want to. Do those six. You know you're you're OK. You you find this? Yeah. The mental thing.
Speaker 3
It's a mental thing rather than because I've said, yeah, I even said to them in my latest not plea but inquiry. You know, following up. I said, look, I'll be. Can I talk to our HR department just to see if it's and and I don't mind what it is. You know it can be. Any any role and admin role, just somewhere within the organisation that they need? Support. I don't, I don't. The the money isn't the factor, it's the having some. Routine and and and comfort while I'm going through this stuff. And again.
Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
Speaker 3
It was no. We'll we'll talk to them, but there's been nothing. Nothing on that. Yeah. The latest call I had, which probably prompted it was like, you know.
Speaker 2
So just not getting back to you at all.
Speaker 3
Friday the 29th might cheer you in. You know his you know, you got what, kit? Have you got a laptop? You know, one of us will have to come in and see what the premise is and that. It just doesn't sit on.
Speaker 2
They're not even responding to those queries, they're just ignoring them.
Speaker
Right.
Speaker 3
No, they they. Well, the the latest weather one was you know we can't offer you within our because they because they've got my replacement already because I did what I think thought was the right thing yeah six months notice they've got a replacement. In for me, which is, which is fine because that was the original intention that evidently as a result of that, no opportunity. It's nothing to to to stay within my existing department.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
Which is then prompted my wallet. Can I speak to? 8 charges to see if there's anything because you're always looking. They're always looking for people you know. There's always something to do and they want contractors in and you know I've got.
Speaker 2
Always looking, yeah.
Speaker 3
Six years of experience now just give me anything.
Speaker
Cool, yeah.
Speaker 3
Today, just to help me over the. Next six months, but not nothing so. Yeah. And I know there's no magic answer and it's just, maybe maybe you just need someone to talk to you, but it's seen as you can probably tell.
Speaker 2
I can absolutely imagine, and I'm really sorry that you're obviously having to deal with all of this. So, you know, along with the diagnosis and the surgery and now now dealing with the, you know, the loss of a job that you were expecting to still have for six months, it's it's a lot to deal with. Uhm, how do you feel? Like you want to move forward with it? How do you what do you envisage doing next in this process?
Speaker 3
Well, I don't. Yeah, it's all my hand. It's almost got to the stage now that I would think I'm. I'm better off out of it and just take my chances because. You know, I I don't wanna go over these eight years. I've asked and asked and I don't want to go down on 1,000,000.
Speaker
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
I don't think. Personally, given the you know, given any company, especially our one, I don't think it should come to that. I think they should be. You know, I've stated why I would like to do another three months or six months. You know somewhere. Social support kind of thing and and I don't you know. And if if they're not willing to entertain that then I'm thinking well, I'm best out of it anyway.
Speaker 2
Their loss, really, then, isn't it? You know, they're it. It sounds like they're giving up someone with with a good amount of experience to just support them for another six months. That's that's kind of how it comes across to me and and obviously it's it's completely your decision on how you want to. Whether you have one last attempt at speaking to them, maybe it's something you need to have a verbal conversation with them about and ask them for a meeting rather than.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
Request it. Yeah, maybe it's a verbal conversation.
Speaker 3
Officially, I'm even handed my notice in.
Speaker 2
Oh, really? You haven't had anything. You haven't done anything in writing?
Speaker 3
What? No. What? What at all? No.
Speaker 2
That's really interesting.
Speaker
Not at all.
Speaker 3
The only the only thing you know six months ago was. Oh, can you? I needed to drop a note to HR to confirm my my thoughts. And it was, you know, his. So I wrote to HR, you know, copied in my. You know my managers and so on to say, you know, it's my intention to stop working full time at the end of at the end of September. But you know, we've had the they've been opportunity to work for another six months and so.
Speaker 2
OK. On did they come back to you? Anything in written?
Speaker 3
Never had anything bad other than you know manager last month or a couple of months ago, just before we went to the operation saying, look, there's nothing within the department. And that's when that. That prompted my OK well, can I speak to HR then?
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And. And yeah, about a wider opportunity outside of that department. I don't care what it is, how much I get paid. Yeah, it's just for my just all, you know, support me in the next few months and we'll we'll, you know, we'll take that out for you. And there's been. Forthcoming on that at all.
Speaker 2
OK. So if we think about.
Speaker 3
Probably need to check. Yeah, I need to. Chase that up and I know you. Haven't got. I know. I'm. I'm sorry. You have to listen. To this, no, no.
Speaker 2
I think that's what we're here for. Like, no.
Speaker 3
It's just that, yeah, I know. I know. Part of the magic. Yeah. But I just feel so let down by them.
Speaker 2
I know, yeah. But let's think about outside of work a little bit here. So what kind of do you have? Hobbies that you do and? Maybe you? Could take on a little bit more time.
Speaker 3
Oh yeah, I've got there's loads of loads of stuff. I mean, I've I've got a nice social life. Lots of lots, you know, lots of sports, lots of lifelong friends through playing sports and so on and yeah. And I want. To get there and.
Speaker 2
Obviously, we'll be taking a little bit easier with the sports at. The moment won't you?
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. What's another thing? I suppose I I think another fact. I've got twin boy. Well, we. Have twin boys? Who are? 18 years old and they're, you know, everything's happening at once. So they're sort of going off into the wide world as well at this time. This is why, you know, I didn't. Tell I didn't tell them my. I have cancer because they were just coming up to their A levels and doing their business. So I think when the worry, worry then so yeah. So there's a lot sort of going on. But yeah as. Sports. I like, you know, walking and hiking and that kind of that kind of thing that. You know, I I haven't been able to think about. What I'm going to be doing, because you know, because because it's. Positive diagnosis, but yeah, I'll. I'll be. Yeah, I'll be OK. Got on share, I'm sure I'll be fine. It's just right at this moment and it just feels pretty.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I.
Speaker 3
Raw, you know.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And I can I completely understand, (Patient Name), it's the fact that you're going from 100 to 0 in a matter of weeks and you haven't actually had time to even. Process what you're gonna do when you retire and how you're gonna spend your days and and actually having those part time hours to, to work around, you know, hobbies. What we're doing, yeah.
Speaker 3
At least not the transition you know, to ease your way into it. Which? You know again other. Done it for other people you know.
Speaker 2
I wouldn't. I wouldn't take that to heart in. A sense that they're.
Speaker 3
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 2
Treating you differently, yeah.
Speaker 3
No, but it's not. It's not unknown.
Speaker 2
It may just be that. Yeah. OK, well. I mean, it's obviously your choice.
Speaker 3
It's helped. It's helped, it's helped. Just talking. Now that that's all.
Speaker 2
What to do next? Well, if you're if you ever want to call back (Patient Name) and and have a conversation again, I'm here. My name's (CST Staff Name). If you wanna have a conversation again, I'm more than happy to chat with you. And even if you know it comes to the end of the two weeks and you just wanna have a talk about it again, about what you might wanna do or if any developments happen in the next two weeks about the role or obviously, if they don't. They don't provide a role. Then please feel free to call back. I'm more than happy to have a conversation with you.
Speaker 3
Yeah. OK. Thanks. Yeah, I don't think there's, I think I just need to take it up again. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I think I'm. I'm coming to. The conclusion I'm mentally gone from there now anyway, if it if it hasn't been volunteered for me, you know this opportunity you you'd like to think they would do the right thing, but well, I'm sorry. The right thing from my perspective. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Oh yeah.
Speaker 3
It just, yeah, it feels, feels a bit pain.
Speaker 2
At the moment, yeah, yeah, absolutely understand that. All right, well.
Speaker 3
Hey, coach.
Speaker 2
(Patient Name), I'll umm. I'll I'll note your name in the system, so if you want to call back, please do and you'll be. In the system already to. Have a chat with us, OK?
Speaker 3
Yeah. OK. Love you.
Speaker 2
And obviously, (Patient Name), if anything comes out of. Your surgery as well, and the results. You can have. A chat with one. Of us or one of the nurses, please do feel free to call back, OK?
Speaker 3
I don't know. I mean, I'll be. I don't know. But I've very used to say this because presumably. Switch off when out.
Speaker 2
Well, what what? What policy do you have with Unum yourself? Do you have one of their policies like?
Speaker 1
Yes, good.
Speaker 3
Is under income protection and.
Speaker 2
So do you. Have income protection with them at the moment.
Speaker 3
Concentration and nice puzzle, that kind of obviously, yeah. Yeah, definite service.
Speaker 2
OK. So what? What? Ohh. So is it group life or is it income protection? Because there's two different ones.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I think it's under the group income protection.
Speaker 2
Said the ship.
Speaker 3
Yeah, the Yep, yeah.
Speaker 2
OK, let me just. Because if you are in competition, then what we could do is just get you signed up to the system now and even if you finish in two weeks, you still have our support for two years. If that's the case. So it's fair to get you signed up now rather than not. But I just need to double check that. So can I just take down your number and I can.
Speaker 3
OK. Yes, perfect. Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Give you a call back and we'll chat.
Speaker 3
Yeah, sure. Yeah, it's (patient phone number).
Speaker 2
098. If it is group life, it is just our cancer assist service, which is more just one off calls and and chats and things like that and any you know small support things that you may need in terms of sign posting and things like that. So I'll be sure to call you back and let you know either way of which one it is. OK.
Speaker 3
OK, lovely.
Speaker 2
Well, hi, (Patient Name). I'll call you back shortly.
Speaker 3
Great. Thank you, (CST Staff Name).
Speaker 2
Take care. Bye.

Speaker 2
You I've just took a call from this number. I think it was probably (CST Staff Name) or possibly. But I don't know, I just couldn't. Couldn't hear the person on the other end. I don't know if they could hear me.

Speaker 3
Hello, (patient name). It's (CST Staff Name). Thanks for calling back.
Speaker 2
Oh, it was you ringing me? Was it? Yes, it was. And it just happened. So no, I don't know. I just, you know, the call connected as far as I could. Hey, but I just couldn't hear you.
Speaker 3
So if you.
Speaker 2
Can hear me?
Speaker 3
No, I couldn't. Oh, no, no, I didn't know anything. It just it sort of just went completely quiet. I thought I didn't know what. Well, mine. Yeah. Well, technology.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Thanks for.
Speaker 3
Back. Yeah, exactly. Great. When it works. Yeah. Thank you. You OK to talk for a little while? Are you in the middle of something, huh?
Speaker 2
Yes. No, that's fine. Yeah. So I was, I was working this morning, right, but. Yeah, I'm not working now.
Speaker 4
What's your job? What do you do? As a job.
Speaker 2
IT support.
Speaker 4
Oh, right, OK. OK. Just got our phones out then.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm not an expert on phones. I'm only like first level. If we can't fix it, we'll pass it to some someone. Further up, but. Yeah, I've, I've. I've worked my career backwards. I used to be used to have, like, a a more, more technical job than I've got now.
Speaker 3
Oh brilliant. Yeah, OK. Oh, really. OK.
Speaker 2
Specialist engineering. But now I'm just doing just doing sorts of service desk, but it's for charity, which is nice, so that's nice.
Speaker 3
OK. Oh, that's good. Oh, good for you. Well, I'm sorry. Obviously very sorry to hear what you have to go through at the moment. Must be very stressful for you.
Speaker 2
It's just been one thing after the other. Yeah, I had an accident earlier this year in Turkey and just get just an over that and then and then this. And then those things before the accident actually.
Speaker 3
So I saw yeah, so.
Speaker 2
So ohh well, I've got. I've got bipolar and had quite a bit of episode with that earlier in the year. And then then just about getting right in time for the holiday and then four hours into the holiday at the accident. And then just literally just getting back on my feet, I think I've been off the crutches about a week when.
Speaker 4
Oh goodness.
Speaker 2
No, I thought. I'm just thinking, yeah, when I when all this started, I was I was still in the booth and on crutches, yeah.
Speaker 3
My goodness. Could you find a lump? Then or did you have a mammogram or?
Speaker 2
Well, 4, four years ago I had atypical hyperplasia, right? So because of that, I was having a mammogram once a year.
Speaker 4
How was it?
Speaker 2
But I wasn't too worried because it's a risk factor, but it's only. I think the chances of it turning into anything more nasty in the next five years is only seven, 7%. So I thought, well, I'm I'm quite a numbers person I thought well that's that's not a very high risk, you know, but someone's got to be in the 7%, haven't they? So complete completely logical. But I just thought with all the things.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Recently, surely I'm not gonna. I'm not going to be in that group as well, but.
Speaker 3
Yeah, it's great that I've got. Offered that one.
Speaker 4
Ohh gosh, Oh well good.
Speaker 3
Job it was being kept an eye on, obviously. Good shopping picked. It up from years ago.
Speaker 2
So I wouldn't, I would just wouldn't have done. I just wouldn't have done otherwise. And even on the mammogram, what they actually spotted was.
Speaker 5
Nah, Nah.
Speaker 2
Lots of small tumours which turned out just to be diesis.
Speaker 3
Right. OK.
Speaker 2
But the main tumour itself, which was over 5 centimetres, they didn't. They couldn't see it. It was only after the surgery. So I don't know why that is, whether it was just low density but.
Speaker 3
You know. So yeah, I suppose it's. It's like it's been caught when it has. Yeah. OK. For the sorry for the only actually found it when they did the surgery. Yeah. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Well, that's the only thing you've got to take away thinking that was lucky. It was fine because obviously.
Speaker 2
That that's the the main tumour, yeah.
Speaker 3
You know, relatively an early stage by the sounds. They're giving you a grade or stage or. Yeah, it's grade two. Stage two. Right. OK, good. So yeah, I.
Speaker 5
Mean it's good, but at. Least it's right.
Speaker 2
Well, yeah. I mean, they took central node six, it's length nodes and they were all. Yeah. OK. Which is which is great. And obviously I understand they have to do that to check. I am a bit worried about things like lymphedema as a result of that. It's only really recently I've started thinking about that and basically I've I've had. I've had one health.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Problem after another right being about two years old and my approach has always been to sort of. Save what I can with the. The idea of retiring as soon as I can, so I just got to the point of being. You know, a year, a year to two years away from that.
Speaker 3
Oh, really? Yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I've written myself a big list of all the things I want to. Do when I. Retire, which I can still do. And I know, I know, in the grand scheme of things, something like if I get through all of this and I'm just, even if I do end up with something like lymphedema. Or I'm certainly at risk of it. I've been told. So I I know I shouldn't be too worried about that, because at the end of. Not dying of cancer is more important, isn't it? But the more I thought about it, it's sort.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Of seeping through a bit, but an awful lot of the things I want to do when I retire. I may not be able to do now really, because well, just lazy.
Speaker 3
You're quite an activist. By the sound of.
Speaker 2
It well, while swimming is is tough. List. I've done it quite a few times. I absolutely love it, but you know.
Speaker 5
Alright, yeah.
Speaker 2
My best friend chastises me, but because I'm very I can be very impulsive at times and you know she's the opposite. She would do a research and work out where the cleanest water. Is where. It's safe and I'll just see it. A nice I'll just see a, you know, a nice river and jump off a bridge into it.
Speaker 3
However that.
Speaker 2
I mean, actually I don't. If you remember about Ohh what year was it? Just before COVID I think 2018 think we had an absolutely huge heat. Wave and my my husband died nine years ago. Very, very, very suddenly and well, his actually his accident was very sudden. But it it took 13 months before he died, which was an awful 13 months.
Speaker 3
That's awful, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, very tough.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's actually sprinkled at the ringer Brodgar, which is it's a stone circle on or.
Speaker 4
Oh my.
Speaker 2
He he was. He was a clean archaeologist.
Speaker
He was a.
Speaker 2
Ohk. OK. He wasn't professional and he didn't get paid for it, but he was. He was a qualified archaeologist. Ohh wow. He's passionate about things like that. So that's where his ashes are. So that's summer. I've planned about two weeks to drive to Orkney. And and I did that and it was even in northern Scotland. It was ridiculously hot. No one believes no one believes me that in aught me it can be 90 degrees it was.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, did it did it slowly as a road trip. Let's drive. Yeah, it's a long way to drive. Yeah. And I I stopped in one area where. Glencoe, Glencoe. Which the the scenery there is absolutely stunning. I've never been there before and I went to work. I parked the car, I went, I went to walk and it was so hot and I just came across this beautiful river.
Speaker 5
Oh yeah.
Speaker 2
With a a bridge over it and these big stones and I could see one that was very, very deep, a big plunge pool. So it just jumps in, fully closed my plunger. I did. I tied my car keys to me.
Speaker 4
When you on your own.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I thought. I thought my car keys to cord on my trousers.
Speaker 3
Goodness, that is brave.
Speaker 2
I did have. I did have a very old basic car at the time, so there was no electronic or anything. It was just a case and yeah, but.
Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, alright. Yeah. Wow. A good feeling there.
Speaker 2
Yeah, well, I've had severe mental health problems most of well since I've been about. Haven't seen and it's moments like that where it's just euphoria and it's. It's one of the few times you feel like you escaping it. Just not be able to do that to me is a big deal. On that occasion, or I thought there was nobody else around and long. Behold a group of a group of Jeff, what looked like Japanese tourists appeared, and they. Were all points in taking photos? They just. Thought was completely mad.
Speaker 4
Oh my goodness. So when it's just come and watch the local swimming that was you. Yeah. Yeah. So I.
Speaker 2
Want to be able to do things like that, and I don't know whether I can and you know.
Speaker 5
Yeah, I mean.
Speaker 3
Obviously, while still on the Kingdom, you've got to be a bit careful, obviously about, you know, be careful about your wound healing and things like that.
Speaker 2
But yeah, at the moment that that's fine. But I just hope few years down the line I can still do things like that and.
Speaker 3
Yes, no reason why not. No, no reason why not.
Speaker 2
I've always wanted to go and. I've said for years. I want to go and live abroad for.
Speaker 3
A year, right? And.
Speaker 2
And whether it would tie in with this or whether it be two separate things, I'd also like to volunteer abroad.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
But I'm not. I'm not a city person at all. I mean, I come from Manchester, but it was right on the outskirts, quite small place.
Speaker 3
Right. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
So I don't mind a few days in the city, but part of my bipolar I get overloaded with. With, you know, sort of noise and hustle and bustle and that sort of thing. I can't cope with it for.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Very long. So you know, if I for go abroad to do some volunteering, I'd I'd like it to be somewhere, you know, out in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, I don't mind discomfort. I don't mind. No electric. I can sleep on the floor, that sort of thing. My sister did exactly that and. You know, she she she talked about it ever since.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Have you looked into? It already like something like voluntary service overseas or anything or.
Speaker 2
Well, I did have the job. So the job I've got now work for charity. It's a lower level job and and lovely supportive company and that's why. Know was it but the last the last job in engineering I had.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
It was. It was a brutal atmosphere and people were dropping like flies. Really. It was. It was awful. I was in a team of 6 people and within 12 months of this company taking over 5. Left one way or the other three of three of us on long term sick, one just walked out and. Sold what they could do. With the job and that sort of thing. So. What was I going to say about that now?
Speaker 3
To see and your sisters done it.
Speaker 2
Yeah, at that point, yeah. You're thinking about maybe. Yeah. At that point, I thought because I've got a bit of savings behind me, I thought because I I've I've never ever done it in my life before, but I was off sick for a year then and. For the first part, just getting out of bed and getting dressed I couldn't even. Do that some days.
Speaker 3
Right. Yeah. No.
Speaker 2
It was. It was really bad. I mean, I can. I can see with hindsight, it was. I shouldn't have kept going to work as long. As I did, I just kept. I just wouldn't give up. I just kept.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Difficult. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Pushing myself. Yeah, I thought about that point and I got to the point of I spent quite a bit of time talking to different organisations. That there's actually quite a lot of companies out there that say they do volunteer work abroad. For people when? You look into it, it's very expensive and when you look a bit further. Right. Yeah, it's actually, you know, private companies behind it a lot or not.
Speaker 5
You in.
Speaker 2
But I found one that was you only sort of paid what it took you to get there and a little bit to cover your board and that sort of thing. And then COVID hit and that organisation just folded basically. Ohh right.
Speaker 4
Right. OK.
Speaker 3
OK. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they will. I mean, so that's one of your big goals, is it to do that that I don't blame you. Ohh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
So I've not seen anything since then. Yeah, yeah, definitely depend depending how things work out both with me and with. Bigger things in the world, and I mean one possibility, not the area of the world I was originally looking at, but one possibility might possibly be Ukraine.
Speaker 4
Yeah. OK.
Speaker 2
Very strangely, for a 53 year old woman, I'm I'm I'm flexibly A qualified builder. Not to say I'm. I mean, particularly because of things like lymphedema risk. I'm not going to be working on a building site. I'm not physically able to do that anyway. I'm not strong enough.
Speaker 4
Oh yeah. Wow.
Speaker 2
But I've went to building college for three years and I understand construction and how things work and.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
You know what? What an architect does? What? What Clarke works does that sort of thing. So Ukraine's going to need, you know, a lot of, lot of rebuilding upon.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 4
We build them.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
And I've got a lot to do with Ukraine. You see, I've got a refugee living with me.
Speaker 3
I saw I've I've read some. Of the notes that Jodie took you've. Already. Yeah, from the living room. Haven't you? Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 5
Ohh wow.
Speaker 3
It's amazing. Well, don't let. I mean, don't let. Your dreams be shattered because. They've taken 6 nodes. Lymph nodes. I mean, you've got about 30 generally in the sort of axillary area.
Speaker 2
Right. OK. I didn't. I didn't actually know the one. One thing I've been quite good at asking questions because I like that anyways. But you know, over time sometimes little other thoughts creep into my mind. Do you think we should have?
Speaker 4
You know.
Speaker 2
Asked this, we should have asked that.
Speaker 3
Yeah, of course. You can't take on. Everything at once? No.
Speaker 2
Absolutely. So what's up 6 box?
Speaker 3
No, I mean I know this. Tends to happen this, the other should. You know, the others should compete. Yeah, yeah. And have you been given any kind of? So you had your surgery at the end of the 15th of August. OK. Yes, yeah. That recovery going have you been given any kind of sort of gentle exercises to do with your arm, your shoulder or anything?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I've been given physio exercises which for the first six days after surgery. I have the drain in and I think I must have been unlucky because where it was well, right at the beginning, it was. If I'm literally moved an inch, it was horrendously painful.
Speaker 3
Catching the nerve.
Speaker 2
It was really hard just getting to the car and getting home. But Despite that, on the 2nd, so it would have been that, not the day the surgery. Two days after that I thought well. I'll. I'll. I'll even though it hurts to move. I'll. I'll try and you know, start the physio because you know it it the information said if you can try and start the day after surgery or I just couldn't that day so the.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 5
No, no.
Speaker 2
Day after that. But I just, I just couldn't. I just moved my arm. Was just so painful.
Speaker 3
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, you've got.
Speaker 4
To there's a.
Speaker
There's a.
Speaker 3
Far a balance of you know, I mean, you've got to care for post up anyway to not cause more bleeding or anything as well. So there's a little bit of time where it's got, you've got to just let your body recover. Yeah. But you know from now on, you can still help with the lymphedema thing by doing the exercises and you know you're massaging your arm, that sort of thing. So it's not, it's it's difficult to say. I mean, this is to say you're risk. Yes. Every anyone that has any lymph has taken away possibly, but yeah. The others will take over their roles and still work fine. I hope so, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so don't let that be, you know.
Speaker 2
You know, warrior.
Speaker 3
Well, it's normal to start worrying about because your body's completely, you know, you've had lots of changes to go through. And of course, it hasn't been your choice. It will probably haven't quite quickly, I think so. But but no, that's not too many. I mean, lots of ladies have more than six taken, is that, I mean, I don't what?
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah, I've.
Speaker 2
Don't know is the IT was 6 that was taken but I don't know whether it's six because that was all the Sentinel modes. I'm not too sure. Whether they would all be Sentinel nodes or some would be.
Speaker 3
No, no. They tend to take. I mean, I don't come on, you know, sometimes they they use a dye and they see which ones pick up more dye.
Speaker 2
Or some date of the date of the day, yes.
Speaker 3
OK. OK. So normally they're guided by the fact that I don't know, I think it's a blue colour. I can't remember now. But they pick. Up all those. Ones have like taken up more dyes. They're probably slightly inflamed ones, so they'd be the ones that be more suspicious.
Speaker 4
Oh, sure, yeah.
Speaker 2
So they say those.
Speaker 3
Test them. They take the Sentinel node as well. The nearest Sentinel node to the tumour. Yeah. And if that's positive. They told you the book, the Sentinel node positive. They told me they're all negative. OK. Right. OK. I mean, that's obviously really good news then. But as you said, it's a shame. It's a shame, in a way. They had to take them. But otherwise, sometimes they take them and then they test them. And then later on they find out. Oh, that was positive then. They have to. Go back in and remove more so then it means they go for. Two operations. So in a way it's better that it was all done. Yeah, but, you know, yeah. So. So no, they're not all central node. The others would be sort of secondary kind of nodes to. That button the fact, as I say, that sometimes think all that looks a bit inflamed, or it looks they take those. So if they're all OK, then the others are going to be fine. What they are, that's the view they take. Yeah, so, so yeah. But as I say, yes. It's about in. Your actually there are between 20 and 30 on average, so there are lots of others that will just carry on doing the job and and you know filtering through and through.
Speaker 2
Hopefully, yeah. And and certainly well certainly before my accident in Turkey, I was. I was quite active, but I've not always been all my life. It's been very hit and miss. I mean, I used to work when I was an engineering. I used to work very long hours for well years, so particularly like when my son was young.
Speaker 3
I don't like it.
Speaker 2
I was either working looking after him or taking out.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, but probably when you're younger, you that it doesn't matter so much that you've taken up now. You know. Yeah, yeah, really. You know, our muscles do need more exercise now. Must be the same. And you know, we have got to take a bit more care of our body. So the fact. That you're doing. It now is really good so.
Speaker 2
Yeah. No, I do miss. I do miss swimming that that was. That was something I was doing quite a bit before before my accident.
Speaker 3
Think you know? Right. And you're going to have a pitch signing tomorrow.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't swim. And I couldn't for quite a while, obviously, because I was in. Well, first of all, it was plaster. And then one of those boots, so.
Speaker 3
It's got a nine. Of course, yes, of course you had. Your foot to deal. With first and then yeah, yeah. Ohh goodness yeah. That's that's yeah.
Speaker 2
And my thought there's a thing I do like. I've done a little bit of running in the past. But I'm I've got a problem with my one of my knees and I've I've got that. What's wrong with me? It's ridiculous. Not a lot of it's not serious, but I have a problem with my knee because my thigh bone is rotated. It's not straight, which they thought for years was to do with the bone disease I've got. But then later on they decided. No, you've just got.
Speaker 3
OK. Right.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
OK. Like nothing, no particular calls.
Speaker 3
All right. OK. So have you got a bone disease as well?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I've got something called alias disease. Yeah. OK. Nobody's ever heard of it.
Speaker
She has.
Speaker 1
To take any.
Speaker 3
But no, I'm just. I'm thinking I have. Do you have to take anything for it or is it no, it's or anything it it's.
Speaker 2
Largely regarded as a a childhood disease and really the the sooner you stop growing, the better and unfortunate that point of view because like many people in my family.
Speaker 3
Do you know what I mean? Actually now then yes.
Speaker 2
I I stopped growing when I was 11, so it it didn't develop. I I think things have improved now, but when when I was a child. Quite a lot of people, because it would develop its hands and feet mostly, but it would. Then develop in the legs.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 2
And quite a lot of people did end up in. Wheelchairs because. The the technique, the technique you end up with different length legs, but because it's diseased bone, it's not, it's not solid bone or not. As it as it should be, he couldn't doesn't have the techniques to lengthen the shorter leg.
Speaker 5
Right.
Speaker 2
Because it would work on normal bone, but it wouldn't work on people with olias, but I think that's improved a lot now, but because I stopped growing, my hands were quite badly affected. But honestly, compared to all the things it causes me virtually no problems.
Speaker 4
Alright, OK.
Speaker 3
All right, that's good.
Speaker 2
The my left hand is mostly diseased bone, and most people don't even notice. But yeah, the last time I looked. Odd and like a lot of people do, I've just adopted things. If I grab all the something heavy to lift it, I hold it in a different way because I know where the the strength is and where the weakness is.
Speaker 5
OK. Yeah. Yeah, well, that's.
Speaker 3
Good for your engineering mind. That's very helpful.
Speaker 2
Because yeah, if you give a list of everything wrong with me. So the average doctor. What they're really interested in is the olias, because it's it's so unusual. But in terms of how it affects me, it's insignificant.
Speaker 4
Oh really?
Speaker 3
Right. That's one of the neatest things. OK, that's interesting, isn't it? Yeah.
Speaker 2
It is supposed to have only found out in recent years. It is supposed to have some increased cancer risk with it. But very specifically, and I don't understand why, but very specifically for liver and ovarian cancer, but not for anything else, there's no increased risk for breast cancer. So I can't blame that.
Speaker 3
Just have to look into that magasa. Delivered because it's. Obviously metabolising everything, and if there's an extra sort. Of you know any calcium or phosphate or anything that going into the bloodstream may be, you know, damage the liver. It's almost like a hormonal thing. No, no.
Speaker 2
Oh yeah, I actually had a I've had a lot of gynaecology, gynaecology type problems in the past. So I had a hysterectomy 10 years ago, but I had the choice but. I elected to keep my over.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
Just because I thought, well, at that point I thought it probably be good to have the hormones for as long as possible. I had no idea it had any connection to all the years and and no reason why I would think to even even ask that question. And now I know that.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
I wish I'd known because that would probably have changed my.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
But I don't think any of the doctors also knew that either or they would have mentioned it.
Speaker 3
Maybe it's something that's only been missing recently. Discovered the link.
Speaker 2
Possibly. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
It's your birthday tomorrow.
Speaker 2
I've heard the leaflets on that but.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I'm not. I don't. Not too sure what it's going to be like really. It's not right. Something I know much about. Yeah, OK. The actual procedure. I'll generally just having it all the time. Ohh yeah. Just just what sort of experience it will be really. So. To actually insert it, it's. There will obviously put local anaesthetic in the part that goes sort of in the. Crook of your arm, you know. The the fill it vein where when you when you bend your arm just in there they tend to go. And then if it's not, it's a very fine tube, basically, and they have to feed it into the vein and then it's got a guide wire on it so that it can go obviously higher up and then into the top Chamber of your heart. Eventually. You don't feel that because it will just follows. It follows the vein. Once inside the vein, obviously there's not. You know, we haven't got nerves inside inside the vein that you can feel every. Part of it will. Just flow along. Yeah, yeah. And then. Then you know it. It will just sit in the top. I mean, it's a zipper that uncomfortable for some people to begin with. It depends how good your veins are and how easy they can. Find it to begin. With sometimes they use ultrasound fire.
Speaker 2
I I always I always have a problem. I always have a problem with that every time I.
Speaker 3
Yeah, which is probably why they're doing it, because they.
Speaker 2
Have anything it takes for a yeah, that was. That was one of the one of the reasons. Yeah, it just seems to be every time.
Speaker 3
Don't want you have to. Go through that every time.
Speaker 2
I go and give the Lord. It never seems to be straightforward.
Speaker 3
Mm-hmm. No. OK, well, whoever puts this in, I've I've a a a nurse practitioner. One of the doctors, you know, this is something they do a lot of. So they will. Be used to. Doing it got difficult veins. So as I said, there's sometimes use a little sonographer ultrasound ultrasonic device to find the vein. If if they can't feel it, you know palpitating it. Yeah, they can use that to guide them so so if. It's fairly straightforward procedure. It's a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be really painful. And as I said, I'll give you some local incentive if you can fit in. It is painful, just they all can have some more local please, because they can easily. Put some more local.
Speaker 2
Anaesthetic can, I suppose? Is it the same as when you give blood in that in theory, at least, if you're? Well, well hydrated. It should help.
Speaker 3
Absolutely. Yeah. Being well hydrated or help because you're right. We'll come up your veins a bit. Yeah. And maybe sort of keeping, I mean, it's luckily it's the warm weather Now anyway, but it's not keeping that area relatively warm as well. Yeah, like, like, she's got, like a sleeve on that. Side on. Have they said which side they're going to go for?
Speaker 2
Well, apparently they can't use the left. I'm not supposed to have. Any needles or?
Speaker 3
Oh, because you have that side where you've had the mastectomy. Yeah. So it. Yeah, yeah. So over the right hand side. Yeah. Yeah. So if you keep that arm nice and warm on the way in, and as you say, you have. To make sure you have something to eat in the morning and.
Speaker 2
And it should help. Yeah, help me as well.
Speaker 3
Yeah, but they are normally very good. The people that do this and say they're, you know, this is one thing they're doing all the time, so. That'll be we'll be fine. And then once it's in, they will probably X-ray it just to make sure it's in the right place, obviously. And look, if it's, it might just tweak it a little bit afterwards if it's, you know, they've got a. Certain measurement that goes. In and then you just put it back a. Tiny bit then they. Might do that, and then they'll secure it and you don't have stitches. Such you have like a sort of. A sticker thing that goes on your arm, a dressing with little clips on that holds the the the line. In place.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
And then some steri strips over that to hold it all in place, and then you'll have a kind of clear dressing over it so that it keeps it water tight. Yes. Yeah. And it's a bit like the thickness is a bit like if you're wearing earplugs or you know, headphones on that sort of thing the the thickness of that wire, it's about like that. And then now just here when it's not being used, it can be tidied up and put a dressing over. Top you can get little pick line covers. I might send you a little thing of those if you like. Sort of go over your arm if you're wearing AT shirt for example, it might just show it underneath. You can wear it just to protect it a bit more like sports cover and they might give you a. Sleeve to wear when you want to have a shower. Some of them are a bit cumbersome. You can buy one in boots again, I'll send you a link for that. Oh, right. Yeah, that that'd be handy. Yeah. I can't think I'm trying to remember the name of the top of. My head, but I'll send it to you.
Speaker 2
I can't believe in sort of recent months. How complicated showering has been. When I was in, when I was in Turkey, the medical care was great, but they don't provide any walking aids whatsoever. And my ankle was really, really painful at 1st and I was on my own because my partner had gone off to start the tour. It sounds awful, but I didn't want him to lose his money. I'm sorry, and I'll be fine. I'll get. I'll get home. So I was just sort of shuffling on me onto the bathroom, trying to get myself into the shower.
Speaker 4
I have my.
Speaker 2
Look out.
Speaker 4
Wow, you've certainly been challenged, doesn't you with that lately?
Speaker 2
And then. And obviously, when I was in plaster, it was all right when I got the boots because. I could take that off and you know, I could. I could stand. But when I had the plaster on, it was. It was difficult and then obviously recently I've had the surgery so.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. No, it's wrong. Yeah. Well, I mean, most people manage quite well with sticking their arm out in the shower, and some people just wrap things around it, to be honest. But a few layers of zooming.
Speaker 2
I've heard that. I've heard that, yes, yes.
Speaker 3
Around it. Yeah. If you kind of hold your the right arm up. So it doesn't matter if it gets a little bit splashed with water, it just not to have it soaking. In water. Yeah, yeah, you know, not immersed like a bath or. Something so you?
Speaker 2
After the surgery, I managed quite well. That's surprising. Well, I thought with I just took the shower head off and just, you know.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
How brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because you've.
Speaker 2
Hold my hand and just once all round it. And yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Got a shower? Like that can direct when you. Need it? Yeah. Oh, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Or you'll get round this one. It's nothing compared to your foot and everything. Else and the. Wound so yeah. So no, it's a little bit of an inconvenience because you've got it there and it needs to be flushed every week. That's I think you know what most of the fun you gotta go either the GP or to the hospital get it flushed even when they're not having, you know, in between their treatments. But is it the treatment weekly or? Is that too weekly or three weekly?
Speaker 2
Well, I'm having two different lots of chemo, the first one.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
Well, and say lots. The first one is 2 drugs combined anyway it's, etc etc. It's only for 9 weeks, so it's only actually 3 cycles. Yeah, but when that's that's finished I'm having.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. 3 cycles, OK.
Speaker 2
Can't remember the name of it just.
Speaker 3
A minute is it has that been has captain.
Speaker 2
Has tapped into the targeted targeted surface, but also a second lot of chemo, which is factually factual.
Speaker 3
Yeah, OK, you're having.
Speaker 2
That afterwards, OK. So and that's every week for 12.
Speaker 3
Right, yeah. So it's at that point you'll have to go in every week anyway, so they'll be. Like you don't need to worry about the.
Speaker 2
Flushing at that point then, yeah, yeah, funnily enough, the flushing is something that, I mean, I haven't asked, but nobody's actually mentioned that to me and it was only. I was really can't remember which charity it was and I was reading something on one of the charity websites. Yeah, and that. Mentioned it. I think it is in the. It is in the booklet they gave me, but I only got that on Monday.
Speaker 3
Oh, OK, yeah.
Speaker 2
Before that I didn't didn't know that it needed to be flushed.
Speaker 3
But that is the normal policy. Sorry I didn't tell it my background. I used to ask down a a cancer nurse. Now I used to work on an oncology ward where we gave chemo. So I was I was given the chemotherapy and then looking after people pick clients when they when they came back.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I can tell. I can tell you a. Medical person. Well, that's good. I mean, that's a compliment by the way. That's a good thing.
Speaker 3
Yeah. No, no, no, no, that's fine. That's fine. So obviously from me then you have a case manager and she can help with any practical type type of things or chasing any appointments or things like that. And then if you've got any questions you know about your side effects or? A pick line and that sort of thing. Yeah, cause my yeah. Background. That's why we're here. So yeah, so our policy was to clash. Them every week it. Obtained sometimes between health authorities, so obviously it's worth checking, but generally I would say it's obviously because they just don't want to get, you know, a clot or anything stuck in there because you want to keep it free to be. Able to use the next time you go for treatment. So that's the idea of it, just to keep it patent. Really. Yeah. They might change the dressing. But it got a bit grubby or a bit locked up or anything like cheese or dressing as well. So yeah, that's. The bit of an inconvenience are you? Do you live far away from the hot?
Speaker 2
Well, to have the pick line put in is in Liverpool I live in. I don't know if you're are you in the north? Do you know the?
Speaker 3
I've seen for Liverpool, no, we're down South in Basingstoke, but I have. Been to Liverpool? My nephew was. In Liverpool for a couple of years.
Speaker 1
Overcome the fear.
Speaker 2
Well, I live in Warrington, which is almost exactly halfway between Liverpool and Manchester, but like an awful lot of people and Warrington, a lot of people are originally outside as Warrington's grown massively. I'm so I'm I'm from West Manchester.
Speaker 3
Oh, OK. OK.
Speaker 2
Originally and it's quite I don't, I don't know. It's like in other parts of the country. But Manchester and Liverpool. Are only like, you know, 30 to 40 miles apart. And that is why I was on a really good train line. But it's not any sort of bad feeling or anything. But if you come from one city, you never ever go to the. Other cities I mean.
Speaker 4
Really. Yeah.
Speaker 2
I I live my I lived, you know from when I was born. Right, right to early adulthood in Manchester. And never once once.
Speaker 4
Really, it's just afraid.
Speaker 3
Exchange. Yeah. Yeah, no, I can understand that. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 2
You've got everything locally in your system. Why go to another city? If you're going to go to another city, you go to, you go to London. Or Edinburgh. Or you know.
Speaker 3
Yeah. For my further away, get different culture or something. Yeah, OK.
Speaker 2
Don't know Liverpool at all, my partner, he is actually from Warrington, knows the local area very, very well, but knows Liverpool better than I do but the.
Speaker 4
Right.
Speaker 2
We we can't. You can't go straight to the hospital. Apparently it's Potter Bridge Hospital, which is one of the big cancer hospitals in the. So it's a, you know, it's a. Very good. Liverpool. Ohh sorry which.
Speaker 4
One, are you going to sorry.
Speaker 2
I'm sorry. It's it's platter bridge in Liverpool.
Speaker 3
Oh yes, the clatterbridge. Yes, yes, I know. Yes, right. So that's why you're having your treatment, is it?
Speaker 2
Yeah. So that's. Well, that's why moving the pick line puts in. Yeah, I think the the care generally does come under the clatter bridge, but all the rest of treatment, including, you know, each chemotherapy side. Is in Runcorn Holton Hospital in Runcorn.
Speaker 3
Right, yeah.
Speaker 2
And I think that's because I'm in Warrington and Warrington and Halton are sort of twinned that, you know, one of them does that specialises in some things and the other specialises in others. So there's no, there's no cancer treatment at Warrington, everything that that.
Speaker 3
Oh, I see. OK. Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2
At one corner. OK, that's fine. OK. No, that's fine. Not it's as the crow flies. It's 12 miles, but it always seems a lot further because one corn is the worst place I've ever seen for Rd systems.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So. Well, if it's too difficult to get back. To the hospital every week. Some people do manage to get it done by their district nurse or. GP surgery, so it might be worth finding out tomorrow whether they you know, whether they would offer that your local surgery or anything.
Speaker 2
It's yeah, it's worth. It's worth asking. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, my partner's happy to drive me. And that's not a problem. And they. The the cancer unit at Runcorn. It's it's a really nice sun, so it's. McMillan built Sun so.
Speaker 3
Oh, OK, that's nice. Ohh, lovely.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And the whether the chemo was sort of attached to that.
Speaker 3
And there's there's free parking. So it's it's quite, it's quite convenient to go there. OK, well, that's not, you know, it's not a major worry. It's just something to bear in mind with itself, you know? Yeah. Because they tend to. Take your bloods as well. They might take them the day before the next treatment. That explained to you because obviously they before each cycle they need to have a a blood count as well to see what your plate doesn't doing what your haemoglobin doing, what your white cell count and.
Speaker 2
I will. I will. I did have an appointment on Monday and they looked lodged then. Yeah. So whether they'll do it again and. I don't know.
Speaker 3
Oh no, that should be alright. For the first time. But the consecutive times because the.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Chemo wasn't seen. Knock your countdown. They need to make sure that they or so before that you're back up to a safe level before they give you the next day. Yeah, yeah, they'll they'll workout a plan with you and tell you what that you know, they'll they'll tell you when they need. To do that. That you probably need to have a little. Book or a? Diary or something to write it all down in because it's. Gonna start getting. Complicated. OK.
Speaker 2
I'm doing it all on my phone and phone calendar and yeah, yeah, I've. I've put in everything in there. So one one thing I'm not sure about, not what I can probably do a lot about it, but you. Know just sort. Of from a medical point of view, really, I'm just in the. In the past I've always.
Speaker 1
We have.
Speaker 2
You know, if you have. 10 people and you give give them all a cold virus and one of them gets really ill and it goes on for weeks. That's always me. And and and I'm not imagining that. It really is and.
Speaker 3
A time.
Speaker 2
I've got it. Have you heard of Shogun syndrome? But I've I've I've got the query, I've got the. I've seen seen what it says in medical notes it says query Shogun syndrome on diagnosed which is my mother has got it diagnosed because she's got she's got it very badly. It's an autoimmune. It's an autoimmune disease.
Speaker 5
Oh, OK.
Speaker 2
But the best way. I don't think on the the Shogun Society website it explains it like this, but my understanding of it and the best way I can explain it is if you can imagine aids where it attacks the body. Shoguns is like that, but it only attacks the bits that produce moisture.
Speaker 3
Oh, right, OK.
Speaker 2
Most people with it have eye pain. Typically also is in the mouth due to. Dryness. Since I've had since, I've had problems with it, my voice has been so my voice has gone very croaky, which never used to be, which I don't mind because.
Speaker 1
Oh, OK, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Getting the Croaky voice is a lot better than having a painful mouth and dental problems and all that sort of thing. My mum is very, very ill with it. It's it's life. I think so. It's only because she's got it so badly that it ever got properly diagnosed. This think about, I think about 95% cases are like may just a query but and this makes no medical sense. I know it's improved dramatically since I have the hysterectomy.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 5
OK. Ohh OK.
Speaker 2
So it's not the big problem. It used to be, but before that I had quite a few years where I don't know how it worked. It was it was, you know, really bad. I couldn't if I spent, if I spent 20 minutes in an air conditioned office.
Speaker 3
Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
My eyes would be painful for a week afterwards. It would take that long for the tear film to, you know, recover.
Speaker 3
Yeah, OK. Well, so are you on college? Current oncologist is aware of this is hey. Yeah.
Speaker 2
An immune thing? I don't. I don't have quite how I'll I'll respond.
Speaker 4
Yeah. No, whether it's going.
Speaker 3
To be affected or not all lives say is that sometimes the chemo does also cause you to like have a dry eye or obviously it, you know it affects the membrane of your mouth. So you might just have to be extra vigilant. Yeah. Yeah, about things. So, you know, with mouth care, just be really careful, because sometimes it can cause mouth ulcers, the chemo itself. So you might just have to be a little bit more and make sure you're doing a mouthwash after you've eat some food. Keeping your mouth clean. And. Yeah, yeah, in quite a bit to keep it as moist as possible. Yeah, and if your.
Speaker 2
Eyes do start to get dry, then they can give you some drops. I mean, it might be worth even having something just in case. Anyway, I don't use them all the time, but I do have some that are prescribed at the point. Actually, I hadn't thought about getting some of those. I don't think I've got any.
Speaker 5
Right.
Speaker 2
I could perhaps. Yeah, I could post request some from your GP.
Speaker 3
Actually, yeah, it might be an idea because if you start getting dry, if you if you want to come in straight away, don't you? Rather than having to get hold of the doctor. And so yeah, it might be an idea to get some. Is it just? It's just probably something quite simple. Is it the obviously not sort of Medicaid jobs are probably just the fluid.
Speaker 2
It's. Yeah. It's not a steroid eye. Drops or anything but it's. I'm not sure what's in. It's actually. You can't buy them over the counter.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
Preservatives aren't known to irritate people. Shoguns low you know and and an awful lot that you buy over the.
Speaker 3
Right. OK.
Speaker 2
Counter are even you know.
Speaker 3
Yeah, see that? Get special ones. Yeah, I'd say it might be. It might be worth getting another prescription for that then. Just to have that.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that. Yeah, yeah, I suppose the other thing is because. You know, because I'm living in a house with three other people. One of whom works on hospital wards, at least part of the time. You know it, there's more likelihood of. Things coming into the house, really.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's going to be there'll be a time when your white blood cells drop normally about 7 to 10 days after the. Treatment. Yeah. Yeah, that's the time when you just you need to be sort of more careful. Yeah, just, I don't know. I mean, your office, you obviously share the kitchen and bathroom and sitting room, I guess with with the other people.
Speaker 2
Yeah, well, a bath bathroom. We've got an on suite. So it's just myself and my. Partner using that.
Speaker 3
OK, OK. Yeah.
Speaker 2
So that's not too bad. It's it's just, yeah, my my logic. Because she's. She is the lead antimicrobial pharmacists, one of the one of the hospital trusts. OK. But you know, even even at that level, you still have to cover on the road to to she doesn't then work where she does see patients and that sort of thing. So I mean, like in COVID, she got COVID very early on because of coming into contact with people that that has questioned.
Speaker 3
Yeah. On the warden thing. Yeah, yeah. So she'll understand completely then, won't she? And she'll probably be, you know, almost.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Be very powerful. Yeah.
Speaker 4
She'll be really on the ball along.
Speaker 3
With the matter then. Just you know, you've got to carry on living. I mean, people living people have treatment when their, you know, children are at school, pick up all sorts of bugs and everything. So.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
It's, you know, it's going to happen. It's impossible to avoid everybody, really. It's just a matter of obviously being, as you know, obviously using your own plates and cut, you know, making sure that you've washed or start, you know, just not sharing anything that sort of pick up bugs easily or they're going to have to wipe all the surfaces.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Anything like that?
Speaker 2
No, no. I mean I think with with COVID and I did ask about that and there's a a booster that's out now I think and and I asked whether you know whether I should should get a a booster. And well, I'm going to try the GP in the first instance, but it was. It was recommended that yes, I. Should have that and. Job, but it needs to be around three or four days before the chemo and it's it's it can be before before any cycle and there wasn't time before you know the the first one. So three or four days before the second one, it's recommended I get the jobs then.
Speaker 5
Right. No. OK. Yeah.
Speaker 3
Right. OK. Yeah. Because by then, the house, you're coming back up again? Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
I would tell you. Yeah, yeah, I would hope that that, you know, if the white blood cell counts is low, if if I have, you know, should I get COVID for example? If you've had that booster, presumably that that will do a reasonable job.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
The main thing is to. Yeah, with the with the COVID. Yes, that's right. I mean if you. Say that people. Are getting boosters now. But as well as trying to sort of avoid of anyone that's obviously got an infection, it's just keeping an eye on yourself. And you know, if you start feeling shivery or sore throat or you think you might have a urine infection or. Anything like that? You know, check your temperature. And call the number that you've been given, you know, give you enough because the main thing you know you can't always avoid picking up some kind of infection at some point, maybe during your treatment. But as long as they get you on some antibiotics.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
To help treat it then you know that's that's.
Speaker 2
What should be OK? Yeah, yeah. Well, I think with with COVID like 3 out of the four of us are vaccinated anyway.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
The Ukrainian lady isn't an awful lot of Ukrainians will not have vaccines. There's nothing I can do about that. You know, she she's had it. Having said that so.
Speaker 3
The thing is. I was going to say the vaccine still doesn't actually stop people getting it. Doesn't they still get it, but they then can fight it. So yeah, yeah. Having the vaccine isn't actually going to stop you from getting it from them. It just means that they can.
Speaker 2
Fight it better themselves. Yeah, I see. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, so I shouldn't worry too much about, you know, you can't you can't force. Her to if she's not. But yeah, just it's just it's common sense really about the cleanliness. You know, making sure that I guess if they've been preparing food that you do clean up and wipe down the surface before you do your that sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, you maybe use your own Cutler yours and say just make sure that it's, you know. It hasn't been. Just that sort of thing. If you're gonna be really cautious. Yeah. And and maybe just staring clear of them on those days where you really could be at risk, you know. The first site. It's hard to know when you're at risk, but you soon you'll pick you. You'll realise you know, because you could start getting like a little also, and that's obviously fine that a bit run down. That's when the the you know the the white counts a bit low. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So.
Speaker 4
On your on your.
Speaker 3
Portal where you signed up with us. There's a there's a function that you can send chat, so if you managed. To find that yet. I had a notification and an e-mail, I think and say to have a look at the chat.
Speaker 2
I think I did. I'll have to. Check. Yeah, I do remember seeing something like that. Yeah.
Speaker 3
OK, maybe have a look later going to visit whilst you're going through treatments, you might not always want to phone us or fill up your call, but it's really nice to have a chat function where you can just send a message or we can send it to you and say or how you feeling. Yeah, I will. Yeah.
Speaker
Let me.
Speaker 5
Yes. Yeah. OK.
Speaker 3
And then you can just, you know, answer at your own convenience really. So maybe have. A look at that, you know, in the next few days. And see if it's working. Cause also you can get into your own. Portal you haven't. Gone up yet? That's the next thing that we're trying to develop, but so you have to go log into the portal and then on there you've got other things that we can send you resources. There's a bit cold. There's a well-being assessment. If you wanted to do it, it's under a called a support plan as it was drop down support plan and then there's a well-being. Assessment. If you wanted to. It's only about 12 questions, but it's like one to three. And what you're worried about or what's the problem at the time, whether it's pain, whether it's side effects, whether it's nausea. And as you change that, we'll then get a notification to say that this has changed. So if you feel particularly sick or something, then I could think, you know, there's hints and tips that we consult, say, to you to try this, try that. You know that's.
Speaker 5
Yes, well. All the same.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that. That sounds good. Yeah. Yeah, I quite like using chats, that sort of thing. Just. You know, yeah. Used to it with work and that so.
Speaker 3
Yeah, well, half ago, if there's a problem, I'll get some. Jodie, what's tomorrow? You having your pick fitted tomorrow, aren't you? What time are? You going in for that?
Speaker 2
Half two. But I said for the hospital. It's it's you can't park there. It's a park and ride that they provide and we don't actually really quite know where it is. So we'll have to leave in good time I think.
Speaker 3
OK. OK. Yeah. Yeah, well, we'll try and send you a message later in the day, just to see how it went and if we can get through to you, I'll get myself. I'll just. I'll send you a direct e-mail and. And check in on you.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 3
Or if we can call you maybe.
Speaker 2
I've got, I've got. I haven't got. I've got my mom and a couple of friends. Not many people. But coming later, when.
Speaker 3
So you can be quiet.
Speaker 5
On the.
Speaker 2
When I'm home thirsty. Really.
Speaker 3
OK. So of course. Ohh we won't. No, no, sorry. We won't deserve you tomorrow. Of course not. No, we're just at some point, we're just just. So I'm just so you'll be know. You can, you know, access the chat with what I was going. To say really. But it's not a huge problem. We can. Call you or we can e-mail.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I think there was. There was something on an e-mail that I did look at. I've done that. Many things recently. I can't remember what I did with it there.
Speaker 3
I'm sure you have or don't worry, if you get a chance, have a look, but if not, we can always send it. I'll get Jodie to talk you through it. And get it all set up. There's not a.
Speaker 5
Problem. Yeah, that.
Speaker 3
It's. You're with us now.
Speaker 2
Be fine if I always a nice day. I'm sure I can figure it out, yeah.
Speaker 3
Well, I think I probably warn you out of all the talking. So what I'll do is I will send a little e-mail now. I spoke with a couple of things that we were talking about and a few pointers maybe on maybe what to take on Friday when you have treatment or what to wear that sort of thing. Just. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't actually.
Speaker 2
One of the. Most basic questions that I didn't think to ask Mm-hmm was how long I'm actually there for.
Speaker 3
On the far are you having the pick line in tomorrow? OK, yeah. On the first treatment I. Would I would almost write off most of the day because you have to get there and they will double check everything, make sure blood results. OK, and because it's the first time that you'll be having chemo from that pharmacy, everything's double and triple checked.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
I think the epirubicin. Goes in it's red and it goes through. And the sight of. I think think actually both of them are ones that are pushed through by. By the nurse. Before you'll be there, at least a couple of hours.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's an afternoon appointment actually, so.
Speaker 3
OK, OK. Yeah. So wait. Saying, you know, back of the afternoon, then basically I mean I imagine the unit probably places about. 65 or 6:00 or. Something anyway. No. Yeah, it's not just the time that you take to give you the drugs. It's getting you there, checking you in. You know, let's say the first time it takes longer because they don't know you so well and everything's got to be triple checked. And then. But once you've been a few more times after that, it seems to get a bit better and they'll probably give you some tablets to take home. Which is sometimes. That you're waiting for those before you can go, you know, so you might have had your chemo, but. Then you got to take some anti sickness home with you. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, just try take something with you to do because you might, in case you're sitting waiting for a little while, you know, well, you have your phone, but maybe they could book as well or magazine.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yes.
Speaker 3
Or something to look at. Well, yeah, even a film to watch or something. Music to listen to. And I was going to say wear layers because it can sometimes get quite warm in there. But equally, you know, when you have the fluid going and you can get a bit chilly.
Speaker 2
I tend to be very cold person anyway. Yeah, you can get like in the warm weather you can get, you know, find it at work all the time. People are there in the.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
In short sleeves and you know I've. I've got long sleeves on and an extra fleece because I just always bold.
Speaker 3
Right, OK. Yeah. Please is a quite a good thing to take because.
Speaker 2
So I'm always well prepared for that, yeah.
Speaker 3
It's nice and soft and. Snuggly and even take. Yeah, I mean, you can, but they'll probably give you a foot story you want to put your feet up or you might have a climbing chair. Not quite. Obviously all different.
Speaker 2
Well, what did we go in? Yeah, when I had my appointment on Monday. It's like a big open plan area, the reception desk and all the seats were where the treatments given are all in a an open plan area. So so I did. I did see it. It looked like I would say they looked like first class plane seats, first class but.
Speaker
All right.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. Just sort of quite quite big and big and posh for things.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And they were climbed back. So you could. Yeah, like blue leather style chairs sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Well, that's nice then. That's good. Yeah. So, yeah. So in that case, you'll be able to put your feet. I mean, some of my patients used to take their shoes off and put woolly socks on and have them really relax.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I thought it's like there I might. Do that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
More comfortable having, you know, shoes on. And yeah, I mean, they'll probably give you a blanket anyway if you need it and a pillow if you want as well. Just you can relax a bit more either for your arm. Or your head, whichever. Yeah. But it's not. As I say, it's not, it's. I can't remember now. Goes through the drip. Over like an hour or whether it. Goes in the syringe. Maybe the. Difference in the syringe. But if if it isn't a drip, it's about an hour, I think. Let me have a look. How long did you use that? Generally, about up to an hour now.
Speaker 2
Well, that that doesn't seem too long summer much longer, aren't they?
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, some, some are. Some are. I mean, you have to have a bit of fluid in between. They'll they'll flush it with saline in between everything. So you'll have a preemie. And then.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Speaker
And you have.
Speaker 3
One of them. And then they put some finger up and then you have like just flop it. Through so it is. A good couple of hours really for the whole thing to go all the treatment. Yeah, yeah. But but yeah, so you might want to have a little snooze or, you know, at least be. Comfortable. Yeah. And I'm just going to say. Take things you know I'll send like. It's quite good to take something, some, maybe some mints or fruity sweets and suck on because you sometimes get a bit of a funny taste from the treatment from metallic taste. Yeah, yeah, I've read that. Yeah, that can be sort of straight away, can't it, when you're actually having it, it can. It can come on quite quickly. Yeah. Yeah. And. And they normally come round with drinks, you know, hot drinks for you if you want. But if you want to take a cold drink and a bottle or something with some cheese. Or something. It's. Quite a good idea to keep your mouth.
Speaker 2
I've got a friend who's having chemo at the moment. She's a bit further on and it's a foul cancer in her case, so she has a pump she takes home with her.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
Sort of thing.
Speaker 3
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
UM. And I know she's given up tea and coffee completely, I've always. Been a. Bit confused about seeing.
Speaker 3
What? Because she's gone off the taste or?
Speaker 2
No, because she's deliberately not drinking it because. Of the dehydration effect, I've never been quite sure about that, because yes, tea and coffee themselves are dehydrating, but because you're having it in with a load of hot water.
Speaker 5
OK. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Surely that would sort of counteract that anyway.
Speaker 3
Yeah, you're right. I think you're right. Really. Yeah. The diuretic effect in the fact that it's all kickstart your kidneys a little bit doesn't necessarily dehydrate you. No, you're right. So it's quite safe to have tea and coffee. I mean, you know, lots of people think about. Caffeine, but actually it's. You know, sometimes a little bit of caffeine. Good.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll probably just what I was thinking of doing is just sort of when I'm in full work mode, certainly one in the in the old life, in the old, the old, I used to run and I I mean at one time I used to at work I used to drink. Probably at least six cups of strong philtre coffee a day, and it's just what got me through the day, you know? But I don't do I don't do that now anyway. And I have tea so weak, you might as well just shake the tea bag after that. But I really can't see that's going to do any harm.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
No, no, no, the.
Speaker 2
And and then.
Speaker 3
The dieticians won't tell people to give it up. It's it's an, it's an individual choice, really. I mean, some people go off.
Speaker 2
It because of. The taste, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
But no. If you fancy a cup of tea, I'll. That's fine. Absolutely fine, no. You're that really? Yeah, and they do advise to. Drink about two litres a day of fluid.
Speaker 1
But that does, yeah.
Speaker 3
Doesn't have to be. So it can be tea, coffee, squash, juice. You know, it doesn't have to just be pure plain.
Speaker 5
Water. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Just the. Getting it's it's getting all that fluid into your cells and also flushing your kidneys through liver and everything. So have whatever you fancy. Really drink whatever.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I want. I want. I want a problem with that. Yeah.
Speaker 3
No. OK, that's good.
Speaker 2
I'll drink water, refer a bit. I'll just just do that sort of thing. We'll drop fruit, fruit juice.
Speaker 3
And did you have? A key a. Pre treatment chat yesterday. Did they talk about any? Foods that you need to avoid.
Speaker 2
Not on Monday. They didn't sort of go through that other than just, well, it's on the nurses I saw and she she just took a few notes, you know, she just asked if it was OK.
Speaker 3
Right, OK. I can send you a little I can send. You a little bit of. Information on that. It's really the same online purchase and. Shellfish or things that are might likely to cause a stomach upset, basically.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I've read up. A bit on it myself and. I might print it off. Actually, I've got a I've got off a. List I made of. Taking African into consideration, you know just general healthy eating and and anything relating to the chemo, there's a few common what and others few things that seem to relate to. And I just generally made the.
Speaker 3
The doctor have grapefruits or. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yes, that was great. Great, great. Ohh didn't know about Tangerines.
Speaker 3
Well, it's the it's more. The skin. So really oranges and oranges, and that simmers are OK. It's just it's. Normally, if you had like. The peel. There's something in the peel of it, apparently. Can interact with.
Speaker 2
But actually.
Speaker 4
I don't think.
Speaker 3
You delete the pill. Really, unless you have. Of lot of marmalade maybe.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's gonna sound really fussy, but I love orange juice. But I can't stand the texture of the. Skin as the you. Know the the full the full. I never eat tangerine or or oranges. I just drink the juice.
Speaker 3
Oh, right. OK, now the juice is fine. The juice, right?
Speaker 4
Oh, OK.
Speaker 3
Right. That's fine then. Yeah. No, that's good. OK. Well, like I said, I can. I'll e-mail you some over some bits anyway, and I can include that in. There, but you've probably looked. Anyway, yeah, general common sense rid of food safety with the.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I know about sort of soft cheeses and things like that, and not not not pasteurised, but when I saw the oncologist actually I asked a few things to do with a few things I've read related to food that I didn't know whether they were right or not. And she was really helpful and and negotiate a.
Speaker 5
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 4
OK.
Speaker 2
Gave me a sort of myth Busters on food thing which was quite good. The the one thing I wasn't sure about and I've read a little bit about it since.
Speaker 4
Oh, right, that's good. Yeah.
Speaker 2
It's reported in a lot of places that to avoid. Soy well, as a pescatarian, I eat a lot of soy. But she basically said, well, if you don't think it, it's works with, you know, the oestrogen inside of it doesn't work the way they used to think it did. And actually it's not, it's not harmful worth at one time.
Speaker 5
Think it was. Thank you.
Speaker 3
They did because they had plant.
Speaker 2
Instructions then I think, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
But they've now realised that actually, that plantations are quite safe. It's you're right. Yeah, yeah, it's they're completely different.
Speaker 2
It's not open. Today, every day. But you know.
Speaker 3
But you need. To get protein if you're not having meat so.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean with, with me and and I'm having to let this take a bit of a backseat really, but what with me, people would think it's an animal rights thing and it it's partly that. But the reason I don't eat meat is more environmental.
Speaker 3
OK. Yep.
Speaker 2
But just before all this started, I I actually found out that if you if you have basically British slow grown free range chicken, the impact environmentally. Is actually less than most soya. Because boys, you know, related to deforestation and come up around the world and that sort of thing, which really put, you know, the spanner in the works for me, because what I've I've fought for the last 17 years was turned on its head. So I'm not touching me for last time I had any meat.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 5
Oh, no. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Before yesterday was about 7 years, I think, and and I've decided to have chicken but.
Speaker 5
Really. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
I'm I'm only it's only the RSPCA. Slow grown chicken mainly mainly because all the chicken it's grown from eggs to chicken in 30 days and the the birds tend to have a lot of health problems, breathing problems, broken bones, that sort of thing.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 2
So for that, for that reason, they're given a lot of antibiotics and a lot of that does get through to the meat.
Speaker 3
Right, yeah.
Speaker 2
And and I thought, well, I don't really want to be eating. More antibiotics from chicken than than after, you know? So. So it's not so Spencer's chicken, I'm afraid.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I know it's difficult. It's so many. Conflicting things about things and everything else. And it's and as you say you. Know my my. Son, because he has loads and loads of vegetables. And people say to them, oh, but they know about the avocados being shipped over here. You know the. Global climate. So it's really difficult to know what to do right sometimes.
Speaker 2
Or my son's vegan as well is a very, very odd person. I won't go. Into that but. I'll be in a nice way. His heart's in the right place. But yeah, and being from being about 15, he wouldn't eat any animal products at all. Wouldn't wear cotton, which is.
Speaker 3
Alright, yeah.
Speaker 2
Challenging wouldn't wouldn't have, wouldn't have a haircut. I have no idea how that fits in. And you know, everyone says Ohh go out to bit you know, and this is only about 14. Or 15 so. It's nearly 28. I'm still.
Speaker 3
Waiting. I'm gonna wait. My son, then. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think mine is made-up by then. I. Should say yeah. I know it's interesting. I mean, you know, they're being told so many different things at the moment, though, and, you know, we don't know until it proves wrong that it's not true. So it's very difficult. Yeah. Yeah, but sometimes you say we're going through humour. You might have to make a few adaptations, you know. But yeah, your safety is the most important thing to visit at the. But one other thing I did was just going to ask you about, have you talked about hair loss or have you obviously?
Speaker 2
Well, yeah, I mean. I think in the grand scheme of things, and I understand for some people that's probably a massive thing in the grand scheme of things, that probably bothers me, the. Least I've decided that I did ask the questions about, you know, on this type of chemo.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
My wife used to lose my hair because I I I I used to think that everyone who had chemo just lost the hair and that was it. But then my three friends with bowel cancer both haven't, and one went right to a treatment without anything. So I do understand that for the chemo I'm on, it's highly likely.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
I'll lose. Well, I'll lose at least some of. It if not all of it. I've read about cold caps, wasn't terribly keen for various reasons. Anyway, I just thought it's going to be really uncomfortable and really matter if I lose my hair. But the oncologist said to be honest, even with that it will thin a lot and you may still lose.
Speaker 5
No. OK.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 2
Matches so.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
I mean, I'm not. I'm not really too bad.
Speaker 4
So people.
Speaker 3
Are awake or have you got your head coverings? I've. Thing I've bought.
Speaker 2
I've bought some head coverings, just they won't be very warm for the winter. That's the only thing, but they're just basic scarves head scarves for now and and I've not. I've never been a hair and makeup.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Little person's always been a bit of a always a bit of a tomboy and that sort of thing, but Even so, and I've only got shortish hair, but as in, you know, it's not. Not even shoulder run. But I don't like the idea of a, you know. A big harmful coming out, but there seems to rub it in well. When I was young I used to have really, really short hair like, you know, an inch all over sort of thing. So I've decided that I don't yet. I've decided I'm just going to not shave it all off but shave it. So it's really short.
Speaker 5
Nah, Nah. MM.
Speaker 2
And then you know, if there's only a sort of. A centimetre or so of her if, if that starts coming out well, I can have it. Let it come out or or just shave that off as well. So I think I'll probably.
Speaker 3
Yeah. It's good to think about it. Just get your. Head around it as you say, yeah.
Speaker 2
I think I'll I want. I want to have my hair for my birthday tomorrow and then I mean, it's not going to drop out the minute I. Have the 1st. Treatment, but maybe in the next couple of days after the first treatment, you know I'll do it then or get.
Speaker 3
No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 2
My partner to do it.
Speaker 3
Yeah, see how you feel. That's. That's why, I mean, you said you go a bit sore. Helps you. But and it's normally patchy to begin with, but. Yeah, I think you. Know some places of the red come. From the whole you. Know on the pillow is a. Bit of, obviously, it's upsetting. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, you're absolutely right. Put it in perspective. It will grow back afterwards. You know, as you say, it's. Yeah, I know a.
Speaker
I mean even.
Speaker 2
Lot of people.
Speaker 3
Little beanie hats or something that quite, you know, just as you say the the practical thing of keeping your head long. Obviously we're going to be. Autumn now if. You do drive a cold, you might just. Something warm, you know? So there's little, you know, being a hat or a baseball cap or something like that, just to help.
Speaker 2
Yeah, something a bit. I'll get something a bit warmer, I think. Yeah, yeah, I've got. I've got a winter hat that, you know, a normal winter hat that I've worn. Other times.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
If I go outside, I can. I can always. Put that on top of.
Speaker 3
Yeah, you don't have to spend lots of money in my lows. You.
Speaker 2
You know, a scarf sort of thing.
Speaker 3
Just find something you find comfortable or, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes people have get a little bit sensitive. So just, you know, find some nice little cocky sort of feel inside or something or something. You know, something is quite soft on your.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, probably. I I didn't want to go down the wig route, I mean.
Speaker 3
OK, well good.
Speaker 5
No. OK.
Speaker 2
It's I understand for some people that's probably a, you know, a really good thing, but. I don't know. I just just didn't fancy it. I mean, yeah.
Speaker 4
Listen, it's not happy.
Speaker 3
No, I'm.
Speaker 2
Looking at it on the light side, I thought they're not going to have. But a wig that looks as bad as my normal hair looks. I've never been good with. Hair. It always looks a mess. It would be too perfect. Nobody be convinced.
Speaker 3
Yeah. True. Yeah. True. Yeah. No, you're right. It's, you know, everyone. Everyone's.
Speaker 2
Different and it's different. Yeah. Yeah, that's.
Speaker 3
Fine. No, no, no. You have thought about it and you. Put things in place and yeah, fine.
Speaker 2
Lady, I know reasonably well who I think it's. About a year and a half now, she had sort of come to it was, but it was quite. I think quite a low survival rate. The time she had when she got through it, it was like I think it was sort of neck or head, but it it was quite far gone when they found it and her hair has always been her pride and joy and I don't know whether it was on the NHS.
Speaker 3
Right. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Or not. But she got this wig where I could always. Tell the difference.
Speaker 4
Wow, yeah.
Speaker 2
You know the exact colour, the style which have these natural lung braids in it which.
Speaker 5
OK. Yeah.
Speaker 2
You know, I've actually caught hers off and. Attached to them, I've never really asked.
Speaker 3
I mean, they're very good. They are. I have to say, some of them are really good and even work on the chemo ward. We sometimes some ladies will come in and we think you know, and that was we were expecting everyone to be losing their hair in their environment so. So actually they will hold. The problem comes fortune. You can get more. On the NHS. And also sometimes the unit can give you a discount or like the the the NHL will give you something towards something.
Speaker 2
Towards that, yeah.
Speaker 3
I mean, you'll probably talk to other ladies when you're there anyway, and you know. Yeah. Yeah. Service. You know, you might be interested at some point, you never know. But if you're happy to get some nice head covering, then that's fine. You.
Speaker 2
Know. Yeah, I think I'll just go with that. Yeah. I mean, everyone's different. So one of the school friends when I was about 15, she had a a brain tumour. And that was the thing she was most upset about with her hair. And at that age as well. And we really weren't saying it. The wig they gave.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, really, it just looked like a normal hair. I think. I don't know whether they've.
Speaker 4
Watch. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Made it, especially I I mean I I think I think I feel and her parents paid for it but you know and she. Yeah, her prognosis is really, really bad. And she's.
Speaker 3
Still around now. Ohh wow that's. Main thing. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. OK. That. That's good. That's fine. I just wanted to. You know, check on that one then. Yeah, but anything else to society? Other worries, you know, we can go through it at the time and come up for anything, you know. And you're not going to get all the side. Effects you read. About just remember that. You might get some. You might you know, everyone gets a different 1, so it's very hard to prepare yourself. You've got to go in thinking like, well, you know, let's just take these. There's yeah. Yeah. So the artefacts tend.
Speaker 2
To be obviously the the the tiredness. The facade, sort of. Changes with your white blood cell count, but.
Speaker 3
The most all the side effects tend to.
Speaker 2
Be fairly immediate after. For the first treatment or.
Speaker 3
Yeah, if you're. Going to feel sick, to be honest, that's just tends to be the first one. Because you just have to put into your system, so it upsets you know, the balance in a sense. So I don't know whether you're prone to feeling sick. Normally you get travel sickness or anything or. A bit, yeah. Yeah. OK. Well, they will obviously not too bad. OK.
Speaker 2
Not not virtually with. Yeah, I have got many.
Speaker 3
But OK, it's it's ridiculous. But I forget what?
Speaker 2
Things I've got this so one of them does. Yeah, I don't know whether that will relate to it or not. That makes you quite sick. So in that sense, yeah, I'm phones and nausea, but it's not physical to do with the balance in it in my ears. So the cause is.
Speaker 3
Right, different. Yeah. Different. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. No, absolutely. Well, they'll give you an anti sickness as a pre Med anyway and they'll give you some steroids, I think to take home as well and they work as an anti sickness and they they work also to stocking reacting to the treatment. So they will give you plenty to take home and I would advise to take them for the first few days they'll give you, they'll give you some to take anyway, like morning and evening, and then they'll give you some just in case. Yeah, it's sometimes worth taking just in case one, because you know, for the first few days, let things settle and then if you find him not finish it, then just drop. That one off and don't take that one.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
And then things. Like ginger biscuits and peppermints are really good to help you stop feeling sick as well. Quite some packets and biscuits handy if you can tolerate those. Yeah, yeah. You know the melancholic ginger beer is quite good as well. Quite a.
Speaker 2
Nice one. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
But yeah. OK, well, I'll send. I'll send you a little e-mail and I'll stop a few. Notes in there as well. You know, you'll get to get back to. Us whenever you want. To have you've got. You've got the phone number, this phone number if. You want to save it.
Speaker 2
I think the phone number.
Speaker 5
We do that.
Speaker 2
We're losing out with it. Yeah, we'll be back on. Yeah. Yeah, I've got it saved in my.
Speaker 3
The one you just told me? Yep. Phone. So yeah, lovely. That's brilliant. So yeah, we're only obviously here, 9:00 to 5:00, but do. Call anytime then. Yeah, yeah. If you happen to send an e-mail or a chat in the evening, then I'll pick up the next day. So yeah, I see. Yeah, yeah. Or Josie will. Yeah. Good luck tomorrow and have a lovely.
Speaker 2
Birthday. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 3
And I'll touch base again with you, you know next week anyway, but I'll send this something tomorrow as well. Just a little summary of what. We've talked about, yeah, great.
Speaker 2
All right. Well, thanks very much. Thanks for your.
Speaker 3
Time. My pleasure. You take care and speak to you again soon. Thank you, (patient name). Thanks. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye bye.

Speaker 1
Welcome to refrain. All calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. Once you've been connected to a member of our team, we may ask the information to help us verify your identity. Hello. You've called to reaffirm cancer, supported us speaking. May I take your name please?
Speaker 2
Hi there. It's umm (patient name).
Speaker 1
Oh, hi, (patient name). How can I?
Speaker 2
Help you? I've just got a missed call. I think it's from my cancer nurse.
Speaker 1
Who is your countenance? My lovely.
Speaker 2
No. God, I can't remember. Name.
Speaker 1
Bear with me, I can check. So that is (CST staff name).
Speaker 2
Oh, right, OK.
Speaker 1
Let me just pass you through her.
Speaker
I'm going to put you.
Speaker 1
On hold while I do.
Speaker 2
That OK. OK. Thank.
Speaker 3
You no worries.
Speaker 2
Hi there, it's (patient name).
Speaker 3
Oh, hi, (patient name). It's (CST staff name). Here the reframe nurse.
Speaker 2
Hi there.
Speaker 3
Hi there I have been given an appointment to give you a call just after three. So sorry I was a little bit early. If you were busy.
Speaker 2
No, that's OK. That's fine. Good, good.
Speaker 3
So how are you doing? So? I've had a bit of a handover from (CST staff name). I assume you're able to talk to me right now.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. So. Yeah, I'm doing OK. Let's go back up to. Hospital yesterday in London for a urine test and. The flow test because the problem I've got is. It's the amount of weing because obviously drinking a lot of fluids to flush everything through. And at night time. I'm getting up while I was getting up like five or six times. I'm down to four now, but it just feels like my bladder. Is smaller and. And I've been told by the.
Speaker
By the.
Speaker 2
The prostate nurses up in London that things will settle down. Obviously I'm trying to rest and recuperate and. I can't sleep some up every couple of hours week. It's difficult.
Speaker 3
Yes, yes.
Speaker 2
But compared to a week ago, I mean a week ago. I had a bladder infection. Yeah, which was. Absolutely agony and then? And then I had problems with. Constipation, which most people do. Anaesthetic. But I literally they everything they tried it didn't work and I ended up at A&E and I needed enema and my surgeon or spokes on Monday said that it's the first case he's ever known that's needed an enema.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 2
I was in a lot of pain, but that's that's settled down. I've just got payment on kind of weighing now, but I need to keep drinking, so I've just got a good and bear it. But I do feel much stronger and. I managed to get in and out of London on the tube and the train with nose. I was worried about you. Know my Water Works and that was OK. And and managed to managed to get a haircut and get out and about a bit. So I do feel a bit more positive. Of some works through that I can look at. For the next sort of challenge is to. Well, like I keep saying to everyone is when you get diagnosed with cancer, which is a shock, and this all happened really quickly for me because I only got diagnosed that month ago and I had the operation. You know, most most cancers, you can't have any operation or you have chemo radio and. You kind of deal with it and move on, but this this is you've got the content side of things and the section of erectile dysfunction. You know, I'm only 56. It's just massive things to get your head around. So, but fortunately they spare the urethra and the both nerve bundles and either side of the. Prostate. Those spared so on dry, albeit leading to wheels on and then the next thing is on. See an andrologist. But I'm waiting on a. An appointment from my surgeon, but I don't know what's happened. I don't know his secretaries. I emailed him. Yes, she's. Normally not really quick. Because I will see him. Then who referred me to the anthologist because I don't. I don't like to drift because if you let things drift. Things kind of stopped working if you know what.
Speaker 3
I mean, yeah. So when when when were you actually diagnosed? Sorry to interrupt. When was you diagnosed?
Speaker
UM.
Speaker 2
Hang on a minute. Can you remember when I was organised? 14th of August.
Speaker 3
14th of August yesterday. OK, so I'm just filling out some of the information whilst you're going through it and so. So 14th of August, that's only that's only like 4-4 weeks ago. And you've had surgery. It's been a bit of a whirlwind. For you, hasn't it? So things will go on. Carry on.
Speaker 2
Right. With so I've got a new job as well and I had issues with that started on on Monday, but the contrast on Saturday and then. People are going to work for us saying, oh, you know, get your operation done quickly because they didn't want it on their insurance kind of thing, which was a bit insensitive. And they were sort of going. To argue a bit that. The ongoing treatment should be on my old company, but medical insurance doesn't work like that. That basically cover me until the day I leave that company and then I move on to the new one. Just didn't get it. Just create a whole load more anxiety. And the other element, the big picture is my wife had breast cancer, thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer. So between us, we've had skin cancer as well. We've had like 5 between us. It's just like when is this ever end it's.
Speaker 3
Just, yeah, all.
Speaker 2
Right. We've got no luck.
Speaker 3
You've got a lot to go. To be going on. With and with regards to your wife, is that all settled now, or is that still happening?
Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean for breast cancer every six months.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
Seven or eight years ago now so.
Speaker 3
OK. OK, so she's kind of, you know, more or less kind of in. Are they just sort of on active surveillance or has she been discharged now?
Speaker 2
You have a. No, she's on active surveillance.
Speaker 3
Yeah, okey dokey. And you with your skin cancer. What did they? Say that was.
Speaker 2
Well, that was malignant Melanoma. I mean, that was like 2005 I think or 2003 long time ago and that didn't really affect me, to be honest. It just I got the white spot of mould on my back and. They got it.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And they just removed it. Yeah. Yeah, that's often the way things like that. So with the prostate cancer, you've obviously it's still early days. You know you like you say you've had surgery and they've spared the the nerves each side. And did they tell you whether it was all encapsulated in one area or had it kind of spread to the seminar? Physicals. Or was it all kind of? Did they feel like they've got it all out?
Speaker 2
There's all containers in the prostate with clear margins.
Speaker 3
Yeah, earlier.
Speaker 2
There was concern one side was close to the nerve bundles. Yeah, it's contained and they've managed to preserve. They did a nerve nerve sparing, neuro safe surgery. With one of these, da Vinci.
Speaker 3
Machines robot thing? Yeah. And with regards to sort of sexual function, have you managed to have an erection since the operation or is it still early days for you?
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's it's early days, I mean. There's couple of times when I've been for #2 and then it's kind of swollen up a bit. Which is in. I was not what I was thinking of anything sexual. We're just encouraging that something is happening down there.
Speaker 3
Yeah, that's good. And you know, it is early days yet, so things will need to settle down a little bit because you know, there'll be sort of scar tissue and healing and everything that needs to happen down there, which could be why you haven't quite yet heard from the andrology. Appointment because they're probably giving you, you know, they'll probably give you a few months to sort of settle because things might just come back on their own accord.
Speaker 2
I'm supposed to have. I think my wife said that Professor Shaw wanted a follow up face to face in a month's time.
Speaker 3
Right, OK. Is that the andrologist?
Speaker 2
And then. No, he's the. See, because that is the radical prostatectomy.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
And then he refers me to. This other chair andrology or get a referral from him. So it's like a. Standard month post of properties appointment after a month.
Speaker 3
OK, OK. Okey dokey. And did you say that you'd message the secretary?
Speaker 2
I emailed her yesterday. I don't know if she's left her names. Katrina. It was a cat. And then he mentioned someone called Maria. So I don't know. She's on others on the other night.
Speaker 3
And did you get if you didn't get a bounce back on the e-mail or anything you think then did you?
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 3
Okie dokie. Well I mean. What I would suggest. Is you probably try and call them. Have you got a phone number for them at all?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm going to ring her now, and I've got her personal mobile number. As well, I might try that.
Speaker 3
Yeah, just give them a call and then at least you'll know that you've spoken to somebody and you've not got an e-mail sat somewhere not being dealt with, and it might be that she says yes, I've I'm, you know, we're dealing with it, but at least you'll know if you can. Get hold of somebody. OK. So just going back to, so just just obviously that's a lot of information that you've given me already and obviously had a good handover from (CST staff name) yesterday, which was amazing. I've just got a few things that I kind of need to go through with you is what we call like an initial nurse call. So just to sort of. You know, check how you are see what's going on and we then sort of finish off with a few, you know, literally a 2 minute assessment just to see sort of where you are with things so. So I'll just go through things like your your sort of family history and any medication that you're on. So have you got any family history of cancer?
Speaker 2
Oh my dad. Died of lung cancer when he was like, 84 and he was a heavy smoker. Yeah, my mum's got. Blood cancer. But it's treatable. Is it non Linda? What's mum got? What fancy she got? Or is it blood cancer monster or leukaemia? It's not. That's the thing. It's not non hodgkins or. It's. Yeah, it's. Like leukaemia, but she's on tablets so it controls it. I mean, she's 84 now.
Speaker 3
Is it something would it would. Does the the letter CML stand for anything to you? Chronic myeloid leukaemia.
Speaker 2
So what she's got?
Speaker 3
You've got the better of the two. I don't know which.
Speaker 2
One it is it chronicles you. She's got the question right.
Speaker 3
Chronic. Yeah. Chronic. OK, chronic. And she did. You say she's still around? Sorry I missed that. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, cool. Thank you, Paul.
Speaker 3
OK. And was she only sort of fairly recently diagnosed or is that something that's been going on for a while?
Speaker 2
Before, when has that died? 5-5 years ago.
Speaker 1
5-7 years.
Speaker 2
Ago, seven years ago.
Speaker 3
OK, OK dokey. It's just useful to sort of get a picture of. What's sort of going on really in? The family and are you. Have you got any? Allergies that you're aware of.
Speaker 2
No other than Poland high fever.
Speaker 3
OK. Do you have hay fever? OK, lovely. And any medication that you're on at the moment? Nothing at all, nothing for the bladder, no antibiotics, same release.
Speaker 2
No, I've. I've just. I've just finished antibiotics because I've got a bladder infection. Literally just come off from oxin and something else. And no painkillers.
Speaker 3
OK, sounds like you're doing very well. I'm not saying no pain killers. And nothing for blood pressure, anything like that.
Speaker 2
No, blood pressure is good. And we've been out for about. A mile walk this morning as well. Brill(patient name)t up in eating. Properly I'll be doing everything I should do.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. And when they told you that you'd got the prostate cancer, did they give it a stage or a grade or anything?
Speaker 2
Gleason score 3 + 4.
Speaker 3
OK. And did they give it a stage at all? Did they say anything else? So did I just give you the link?
Speaker 2
I said it looks like the letter here intermediate. That the biopsy is demonstrated as an intermediate grade prostate cancer in the prostate, the tumour is grade 3 + 4. It's on both sides of the prostate. The maximum core length is 10 millimetres. In summer of your age we would consider this to be significant significant prostate cancer and you and I spoke about the likely treatment oxygens of radical. Robotic prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So that was going to be my next conversation. Did they say that you'd need to have any radiotherapy or not or they just going to leave it as a surgery?
Speaker 2
That was like the next step if. If ornated it.
Speaker 3
Yeah, perfect, lovely.
Speaker 2
And I said, if I had that first the the options are limited and the side effects could be worse.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Potentially. Yeah, that's right. OK, lovely. So that's kind of most of my questions in that point of view. So the other thing I just wanted to to ask was, do you have any kind of ongoing like sleep problem, anything you've ever had before that we would need to be aware of?
Speaker 2
4 * A night for the moment.
Speaker 3
And have they given you any information or sort of? Advice on what to do about that? OK. So some things that could be really useful is to try not to drink after 8:00.
Speaker 2
At night. Oh, sorry. OK, so they have in that regard, basically SO22 litres. They said you need to drink, but I'm. I'm only like 5 to 7. I'm not a huge boat. So they say cut it down to 1 1/2 and don't drink after about 637.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
The problem I've got is if there's my blood is much. Smaller so it fills up quicker. And he said, you know, you've put his getting used to a whole new system down. And the nurse yesterday said it. It will settle down. But you're bladder because you had an operation and the blood has been emptied. It needs to sort of learn to. Grow and scratch again, but I don't know how. I thought that is still the same size. To be honest, but I don't know.
Speaker 3
Yeah, it could be that your blood has got used to because of the prostate would have been enlarged. It would have been pushing on the bladder then making essentially making the capacity of the bladder smaller. So what it?
Speaker 2
It wasn't charged. My prostate wasn't enlarged, but it was small.
Speaker 3
OK, OK dokey. That's unusual. I mean, maybe, you know, maybe sort of it's more about bladder training. If they did, they give you kind of pelvic floor exercises and things?
Speaker 2
All right. Yeah, did them. For like 2 weeks before or as soon as I knew got the squeeze out.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
And I've been doing. That that gives you remind really easy and yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And you just building them now?
Speaker 2
When I've had.
Speaker 3
They're really important to do because especially as you've had your prostate removed as well, you know it's it's really important to keep that sort of area strong and that will also help with getting rid of the urine in the bladder, making sure you fully empty the bladder. So you're not continually going backwards and forwards to the toilet that things are settled in any way.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
You've obviously, like you said, had some sort of bug, bit of an infection that's, you know, that's irritated things even more, which is a bit unfortunate because things may have started to settle sooner. It does sound like things are going the other way. Do you avoid caffeine and things like that?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean, I've been having decaffeinated tea and coffee, but only coffee only yesterday and tea few days ago. But nothing fizzy. No alcohol, just water.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So that will help. The decaffeinated drinks will help, and obviously the not having fizzy drinks will help as well. Well, if you do fancy something fizzy, you know, have it in the morning rather than in the evening because that can irritate the bladder. My gut feeling is you've had a lot going on and I think things that the more relaxed you become about what's happened and you kind of you're healing and and you know you're feeling sort of more confident as you're going forward. I think you'll probably find that your your sleeper will improve and you'll be getting up less during the night. Four times is still quite a lot. Really, once or twice is kind of OK, but four times is still quite a lot of sleep disturbance. So yeah, you know, it's but hopefully that will improve and.
Speaker 2
Managed to get at once. But yeah, it's not because I'm necessarily anxious or anything because I need a week. Yeah.
Speaker 3
But what I mean is like you know, you've been through a lot. So from a mine point of view, when we go to bed, our minds sometimes kick into gear even though you don't realise as you go to sleep and then you wake up and then because you've woken up, you say, oh, I need to go for a wee, you know, it's it's kind of you get into a bit of a routine.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I did have fun.
Speaker 3
So hopefully that's.
Speaker 2
I've wet the bed once, but that was when we were in A&E till all night. But what I've just. Virtually no sleep before then and then we're in and and then the next night I went. Into a really deep sleep, but since the pads down on the bed and I've been wearing the pull-ups, but I've not had any other, that's the only. Accident I've. Had I've been, you know, the positives are I've got clear margins, it's containing the prostate and I'm dry. The downsides with the bladder infection and the. But the challenges are still. The sexual side of things I'm pretty automate anxious about and all that you've got to. Go through. Try and done that if because I've read somewhere that you should start the OR someone told me that cancer nurses prostate UK that some people start the tablets, not the Viagra tablets straight away. But I haven't and I'm I'm. I'm I'm. I mean, I'm in their hands. And I trust them.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
But he's saying like A5, milligramme dosage of is it to ladder pill or something? Or really it's cool.
Speaker 3
Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 2
I don't want to leave it too long because the long it's like a muscle, isn't it? Pain if you don't use it? It kind of is. All the blood vessels and all the rest of it.
Speaker 3
And have you tried any kind? Have you tried sort of ************? Have you tried anything to see whether you are working down there?
Speaker 2
No, not not yet, because I've been so tender, I mean. I I could try. But at the moment it was just. I just can't see.
Speaker 3
Yeah, it's. It's still early days, isn't it? Still early days. I think give it a few more weeks, I think. See, see what your your consultant says about the andrology appointment and then perhaps mention when you speak mention whether you should be taking anything like the Viagra and that I think I do. I mean personally from my experience I think it's still very early days for you at the minute. You are literally 4 weeks. Quite what is quite a radical surgery so.
Speaker 2
There's only two. Surgeries 2 weeks, 4 weeks diagnosis 2 weeks surgery.
Speaker 3
OK, so your surgery was two weeks ago. OK. Yeah. OK. So really, really early days then. So, you know, I don't want to tell you not to worry because that's just empty words. But, you know from from my experience and I have worked in sort of a urology.
Speaker 2
Yeah, the diagnosis 4 weeks ago.
Speaker 3
Department for some time a while ago. It's that is very early and so far you're doing really well. You know, to try not to be too hung up on that at the moment. They're going to want you to be, at least, you know, probably 6-8 weeks post surgery before they can start to think about whether you might need anything to help you with your erections and things. Because at the moment your poor body is just saying, look, you know, you've put me through enough at the minute. Let's just see how we go, but.
Speaker 2
I had really. Bad. I forgot to mention I had really bad brush on my penis, like in a canister. You can get a tablet and the cream, aren't you over the counter? Which reminds many transport framework.
Speaker 3
Was that before the surgery or after?
Speaker
Well, there was.
Speaker 2
A little patch there and I showed it to the surgeon, he said. Oh, that's fine. And then. After the biopsy and then? It's fine and then it just got really bad. Two days ago when I've had a bit of a meltdown when I was up five or six times that night. Really bad for us. That's why I went to hospital yesterday. Yeah, but that seems to be improving a bit.
Speaker 3
Yeah. What did they say? Did they? Did they swab it or is it definitely crush?
Speaker 2
Well, that's the thing they haven't done that. No. And I asked them is it? And I sent them pictures. And I said he knows it definitely trust. And she said yes, but. I don't without it being tested, I don't know.
Speaker 3
Yeah, that's unusual. So it's itchy. Is it like itchy?
Speaker 2
It was. It was. A bit itchy. But it's not so much itchy now, no. UM.
Speaker 3
OK. It might be that the. Sorry.
Speaker 2
Spoke to the GP and they said well. UM. Speak to the people that did your operation.
Speaker 3
OK. Well, I would say give how long you been on the cream?
Speaker 2
I've been on it quite a while now, probably a couple of weeks, but I've not been doing it three times a day. It's only the last couple couple of in lines when it's more on a couple of days I've been. Putting on three times a day and I had the tablet about three days ago as well.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. And do you still have a, do you still have a foreskin or you circumcised?
Speaker 2
No, I've got foreskin.
Speaker 3
OK. And are you pulling that back and putting all the cream all around there as well?
Speaker 2
Yeah, alright.
Speaker 3
Yeah. OK. So that's that's really important to make sure you do that and it's not over washing as well because that can cause irritation in itself. So you might think different symptoms of flush thrush, but really you haven't so.
Speaker 2
Right. There in the morning and then I've been rinsing that area, so it's clean and then reapplying, but don't. Don't clean it.
Speaker 3
Yeah, don't don't over clean it. You know, just have a wash like you normally would. I would probably not use any soap down there, you know? Yeah. Use something that's very, very gentle, like, you know, like a very mild soap. Like a Sanex or something that's got no nasties in it. Or a baby like a baby's bath sort of soap.
Speaker 2
I'm not using, sorry.
Speaker 3
Just so that you're not irritating it at all with anything perfect. Rooms and then use your cream for a few more days. And if it isn't clearing up, you know, go back to the GP because you can get things like eczema and things down there. So it might be you need something totally different to canister and you might need a, you know, some other sorts of ointments to.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
To get on top of it. But yeah, so just just give that a little while longer and if you're not happy and things aren't, you know, clearing up, go back to the GP and get someone to actually take a look at it and it's it's it's not, it's not the responsibility of the consultant really that's done your operation. You know this could be a general.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
This issue so you know, I would definitely get the GP to have a look if it doesn't clear up. In the next few days.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah, fine. All right.
Speaker 3
OK, lovely. So that's all of that information there. So I just want to go through. So we do this assessment and you can you can access your portal yourself and go on to it, but I'll do it with you whilst we're on the phone now if that's OK. And there's also a section on setting goals and things. So you can have a look at that and. If you want to, you can fill that out. So basically it's in five sections. Just literally I'll ask you 4-3 or four questions for each section. It's very quick and it's not applicable as the answer 1-2 or three, three being like the worst problem that you're dealing with and obviously two being sort of OK in the middle and one being not really a problem at all. OK. Does that make?
Speaker 2
Sense, yeah.
Speaker 3
OK, so first section is sort of physical things. So are you. You've already said you're not in any pain relief for you. Are you in any?
Speaker 2
Pain at all? Yeah, it's it's sore when I want to sit down. It's sore in. The whole area, yeah. And when I we it, it still really hurts, yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So where would you mark that on a one to three?
Speaker 2
Probably about a two in terms of soreness in that area. I want to sit down and a three, one a week.
Speaker 3
OK, OK Dokey and. Have you are? You not currently on any treatment at the moment, are you? Although you've taken some canister for your thing, so would you agree like a? Wand for that maybe? OK. And I'll side effects, you're not on any treatment at the moment. So should we put that down as a non applicable? And how about food and that? Are you eating OK?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I've got my appetite back. Now when? When I have Constipation. I've. I've lost it. I've lost about 8 pounds. Yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, but you're eating OK now.
Speaker 2
We've got. We started doing overland coal organic food orders, which is a load of fruit and veg, which unfortunately.
Speaker 3
Yeah, make sure you make it. It's. Nothing else. Corn and soup.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. So that's good. Got fish tonight. Time for a Curry. But I don't probably a bit too ambitious.
Speaker 3
Why? Why do you why do you not think a Curry?
Speaker 2
Good morning. Do you think if you're alright with all? The sort of. Of some issues I've had probably would be right. Now, wouldn't it?
Speaker 3
Well, it's not. Going to do you any harm if you've been constipated, a Curry might actually sort you out.
Speaker 2
Not too pricey? Yeah, I mean, my poos are OK now. To be fair.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah. You know, Curry is not going to affect your surgery or anything like that. It's not like you're on chemotherapy and you're not going to be able to sort of taste it or anything. So, you know, a little bit of what you fancy is not going to do you any harm.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah, I'm going for a gin and tonic as well, but that's not going to happen, is it? Not for a while.
Speaker 3
Well, you know, we don't see what goes on in your household. You know, if you've been told not to have it by your consultant, then you know that's that's fair enough. But I've I've never heard of that, to be honest. Different when you want again, different when you're on treatment. But currently you're not on anything.
Speaker 2
Too early, early. No, I don't think. They recommend alcohol at the moment as diuretic.
Speaker 3
Or just irritate your bladder? Yeah.
Speaker 2
I'm going to get that. A miss prevail.
Speaker 3
Yeah, give it a wide burst. At the moment, of course, you've got the fizzy water as well with your.
Speaker 2
Tonic. So yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
Have you got any concerns or changes in appearance at all?
Speaker 2
The only thing that I've read about is your penis gets smaller. Is the final kind of insult. I don't. Know whether you. Experienced that.
Speaker 3
I think it depends on whether. You're on hormones and things. So yeah, you know, sometimes people are put on when they got prostate cancer. They go on hormones and that can actually starve the body of testosterone, and that causes, you know, that your your penis to shrink. I mean, the fact you have had your prostate taken away and, you know, your testosterone levels.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
Will drop at some point that you know you could have some shrinkage, but you're still fairly young at the moment. You know it might be something you don't actually notice.
Speaker 2
Right. OK. Fair enough. And my testosterone levels will drop well, I didn't know that.
Speaker 3
Yeah, they they will do because you know, because of how the testosterone is made. So yes, so yeah, they they may drop now you've had your UM prostate removed.
Speaker 2
Right. So does that affect sex drive and stuff like that?
Speaker 3
Yeah, it can do, but you can get you can get replacements really, really easily. You know, there's different gels and things that people can use, but when you speak to the andrologist, they'll they'll be able to help you with all.
Speaker 2
That it's it's creams and injections and this pump thing which I need to order, I need to. Speak to that was the other thing. I don't know what size to get on the pump, but I can bring up there's. A company I found this the. The pump's been recommended by. The surgeon and it's the NHS one. So I found it online and I just need to speak to someone there.
Speaker 3
Yeah. OK. Thank you. Drakey. Yeah, I've not been involved in those sorts of things. So because the andrology sections sort of, it's a different area to when you're dealing with kind of the cancer side of it. It's it's another specialism. Although they kind of link with different nurses and doctors that deal with that, that side of things.
Speaker
Right.
Speaker 3
Like specialist teams that deal with that. But you know, if we, you know, if there's anything we can do from the reframe point of view, we could probably sort of point you in a direction of things if you weren't getting the answers that you wanted. I'm sure there'll be things that we might be able to research for you.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah. OK.
Speaker 3
OK. The other section is emotional. How would you think your mental health is? Have you got any problems or would you say it's a 1-2 or three?
Speaker 2
I mean, it was a three. I was really struggling like very. UM. And very tearful after the operation. Just for the whole magnitude of it and the worry of, you know, consonants sexual. Dysfunction and just generally just cancer diagnosis in general, really. But so but. Because I've been getting out about a bit and I feel more healthy. I'm. I'm not crying spontaneously like I was before. So I'm probably about. Do you reckon the two now kinda. Probably a 2, but I was definitely 3.
Speaker 3
You. You said you was a 10A10 out of three before, but now you would say you were about a 2. Yeah. Yeah, OK, that's fine. Because you still got a lot to. Deal with. It's still. You know, it's still early days, so. Yeah, definitely. And I mean, we can put you in touch with any if you needed to speak to accounts or anything like that. So you know you can, you can, you know, get in touch with us if you wanted us to put you. In touch with accounts or anything.
Speaker 2
Yeah. I think (CST staff name) was going to look at that, but then you've taken over, then she was going to look for local.
Speaker 3
No, I I haven't taken over. So, (CST staff name), (CST staff name) is what they call the Cancer Support manager. So she's not a nurse, but she deals with a lot of the referrals and the chasing and stuff. You know, she's brill(patient name)t from that point of view. And then every patient gets allocated a Cancer Support manager and a nurse. So I'm the nurse that's been allocated to you. So.
Speaker 2
All right. OK.
Speaker 3
I would deal with any kind of UM. Clinical things, any sort of side effect issues sort of any if you just wanted to chat about things. Obviously I'm not a trained counsellor, but we have a level of counselling to a point. If things were, you were really struggling then we would recommend that you would be referred on to maybe a, you know accounts or a psychologist or something like that. Psychotherapist and that we can do, you know, we can find people local to you, but also the I don't know if you ever heard of the Maggie Centre.
Speaker 2
I haven't.
Speaker 3
Maggie, as in the name Maggie's, if you Google Maggie Centre, there'll be one near you and they also offer of counselling things as well.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
And have you ever looked on any of the prostate prostate websites?
Speaker 2
Yeah, prostate Cancer UK, yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, they're they're really good too. They've got lots of sort of forums and things that you can link in with. So that's really, really helpful. But if there's, you know, there's anything else that you would like to sort of perhaps to send you links to, you can either send a chat on the chat and say, look, I'd really like some information on this or you know we can we can search things for you, you can give us a call and and we can send you links. Either myself or (CST staff name) can send you links depending on what it was for. Just. Yeah, just let us know if you need anything like that. So the next thing in the emotional section is relationships and intimacy. Now that, I would say it's probably 3 for you at the minute just because it's really early days and you have talked a lot about, you know, your worries about whether you'll be able to maintain sort of an erection and that in the future. So would you agree that'd be a three?
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And the next thing under emotional it comes under sort of like your your kind of beliefs and how your life can sort of change after a diagnosis. Do you think that's changed at all or are you OK or nothing's really any different?
Speaker 2
Well, definitely, yeah. I mean if there's. Sexual side of things and. Well, at the moment I can't really do anything. I can't, you know, like exercising and. Playing golf and doing yoga and stuff like that and and drinking as well. I enjoy a glass of wine and a gin and. Tonic and. My jobs, there's a lot of entertaining, my job as well. So that was a worry and it's a brand new startup. So I kind of need. To be there and visible and.
Speaker 3
What do you do? With the job, what do you do?
Speaker 2
Underwriter insurance underwriter, insurance underwriter. Yeah. Up in the city.
Speaker 3
Sorry, say that again. I missed the first note.
Speaker 2
You know, there was. A quite a strong. Culture there of. Yeah, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 3
Going out after work and.
Speaker 2
There's worries around that a bit as well, but.
Speaker 3
Where would you score that between 1:00 and 3:00?
Speaker 2
I'm sure we'll. What was the sort of question again is that?
Speaker 3
So it's just this is all under emotional under the sexual emotional, it's called beliefs and values.
Speaker 2
Probably 3 then yeah.
Speaker 3
Hopefully those things will start to, you know, change and you know, feel sort of more normal again for you as the weeks go on. The next section is social, so it just says social relationships, support groups and leisure time, so social relationships is everything OK? You still seen your friends? You're. Still getting out and about.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I mean. You know this working and stuff, but I'm making the effort to make sure I get out now. I feel more confident, so it's probably I'd say.
Speaker 3
Yeah. OK. Two, did you say sorry I missed that? Yeah. Two and support groups. So do you have, like, a good support network of friends or would you be interested in support groups or anything like that?
Speaker 2
Yes, Sir. I think I'm OK on that. It's. Just whether I need. Sort of counselling, but I do feel much broader and much brighter. Honour. I do feel much brighter and confidence coming back a bit.
Speaker 3
And are you managing to maintain any leisure time? I know you said that you like sports and golf and stuff, so that's all knocked on the head at the minute and yoga, I mean, as long as you, as long as you can get into a comfortable position, you could still do some yoga. You just need to take it easy, you know, in holding positions, we've got to do a lot of things sitting down. Anything pressure.
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's not. All right. Probably next.
Speaker 3
Yeah, you could do upper body things.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, I might give it a go tomorrow.
Speaker 3
Yeah, which is all good for your mental health as well, isn't it? Don't do anything that's going to cause pressure in your ****** or anything like that at the minute, because obviously there's a lot of healing going on down there.
Speaker 2
Yeah, my abdomen. Yeah, six holes in it.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah, OK. So leisure times, you put that as. A1. OK.
Speaker 2
I think not much I can do from Cook.
Speaker 3
You've been walking as well, haven't you? Very good for the mind. The next section is financial issues. Have you got sick pay? Have you lost income?
Speaker 2
No, that's all fine. That's all. Yeah.
Speaker 3
No. OK. Lovely. So I'll put not applicable for income loss benefits. You want any benefits at all? And do you have any issues with transport?
Speaker 2
Well, my wife has to drive me, but hopefully in two weeks I can drive again. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
And then the next section is professional. So obviously you were saying you've had some time off and you've just started doing a new job, but has that been an issue at all?
Speaker 2
No, they've been part of the insurance thing. They've posted just get yourself better. The business is still here. Just get yourself better.
Speaker 3
That's really good. And returning to work. Do you think you'll have a phased return or will that be OK?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll phrase it definitely. I mean, I can. I've been doing work already, to be honest, looking at stuff. But it's it's the building. My strength up to commute in and out of London and have confidence around my bladder. Basically the stop I'll have to drink like 1 1/2 later today and I said that to the surgeon and he said. Well, you should be drinking that much. Like that? Yeah, fair enough. But I can't spend the whole time in the.
Speaker 3
No, no. I think some of that will that will ease. I think once you've, you know once things start to settle down, I think that will ease off and you'll feel better about that. You won't be going to the toilet quite so often.
Speaker 2
Hope so.
Speaker 3
And also you know, once you've lad has settled down from all that infection, you've been on a lot of antibiotics and things, all of those things can make you feel you. Know one anxious and two can irritate the the you know the bodies, sort of the bowels and the bladder and all of those things. So hopefully that will sort itself out.
Speaker 2
Right. OK.
Speaker 3
Lovely. Now it's up to you. Do you want to set any goals now, or would you rather have a look yourself? Or just do you not want to? Do that. What sort of things are they? Just have interest so so you can just set your own goals so it could be things like. I don't know. I'd like to be getting back to yoga or. You know, it's all. It's all. All whatever you want, if you say I want to start walking my dog 10 miles again. You know it's about setting goals for yourself. It's nothing to it's not what I would want for you. It's what you would want. And sometimes people say it's just being able to read a book, you know, increase the concentration or it's whatever it is. It's up to you really.
Speaker 2
I'm pretty self motivated discipline so.
Speaker 3
OK. So should we leave the goals for now?
Speaker 2
Oh yeah.
Speaker 3
And you can. Always we can always come back to them. Or if you you know, if you want to go into later on, if you think, oh, actually that might be useful to pop down. You know, you can go onto your portal and you can you can log. In and. Do that yourself your support. Plan will be on there as well, so. Lovely. Excellent. So I think that's kind of it for me. Is there anything that you wanted me to send out to you right now? I know you OK.
Speaker 2
Really nice. Just maybe because counselling stuff. But I do feel a bit brighter and. I've had sometimes counselling to stirs everything up. And it's good to saying I've been getting stuff off.
Speaker 3
Sometimes it's good to get things out. Yeah, yeah. Macmillan. Also, do I think it's six sessions with Bupa and they're they're free, so you can also go through McMillan and they they also do, I think it's well they are online, the counselling sessions, but you can also access that as well.
Speaker 2
My chest but. I'm going. Right. Right.
Speaker 3
You can do that if you wanted to.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll ever think about that. Yeah, I'm OK at the moment.
Speaker 3
OK. Yeah, well, you've still. Got everything, but you know the way you're feeling is totally normal at the moment because you've been through a lot in a very short period of time. You know, I was thinking you'd had surgery 4 weeks ago and it's only two weeks ago, you know, so four weeks ago, you hadn't got a diagnosis and now you have and you know you've been through surgery. So you've been through. A lot. And it sounds like you're doing really well.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And I like had the operation at. I've got there at 7:00 AM commuting from London and a half four. And then I think that down till 3:00. So that's like 8 weight shifting yourself. And then then then they kick you out the next day. Yeah. Go home on public transport.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
It's absolutely brutal. Yeah. Nice. Get on your feet and move around. But bloody hell. I mean, I know I was. The youngest there, but. OK. Yeah, whatever. It's quite tough, but it's to sleep. You know, I didn't have any. Didn't really have sleep for two weeks. We're waking up every couple of hours. See if the catheter bag was filled up because it's filling up so quickly at the beginning with all the fluids. They're pumped into me and it was boiling hot and then I'm still not really getting a proper night's sleep because I'm up peeing. That's that's challenge. At the moment, but I hope you know everyone's telling me. You know you're a nurse and nurse the nurse yesterday saying it will settle down. So I'm just.
Speaker 3
You know. Yes, definitely.
Speaker 2
I've got that basically, yeah.
Speaker 3
You know, and it's also just, there are little techniques of sort of making sure your blood is fully empty, so you can kind of like, you know, you go to the toilet and then you just wait, stand up, wait for a minute and then, you know, or whether you sit or stand, you know, wait for a minute and then go back and just see if you can empty any more out. And sometimes you can do. You can kind of kind of milk the bladder slightly so. So if you just put your hands sort of behind where your testicles are, your thumb and you just sort of push that forward because your bladder sort of sits in that perineum area, you can just sort of push that, and that can sometimes bring out a bit more urine and just finish it. I mean, I've heard a doctor call it like milk in the bladder, but.
Speaker
All right.
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
Kind of like just sort of doing a gentle, very gentle push in motion and it might just stimulate your bladder to say, oh, hang on, there's another 50 mils in there, which might be what's waking you up another few hours later. So yeah, there's just a few little techniques when you've been through what?
Speaker 2
Right.
Speaker 3
You've been through so. Lovely. Thank you. Doki. Well, look, it's been really lovely to speak to you. I will probably. So. Have you got any more hospital appointments at all? Come coming up.
Speaker 2
No, nothing imminent, no.
Speaker 3
Nothing imminent. So are you happy to use the chat function?
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's good. That works.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So if you pop, if you pop on the chat, when you get your andrology appointment. If you know it's not happening, they're not doing anything. Let us know and we might be able to search something for you. That's sort of local to where you are that we might be able to push for you, you know, can't make promises, but hopefully they're going to do what they've said they'll do in your team.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
But you know, we are here to try and help you in any way we can. So just, you know, send something on the chat. But if you get your appointment, let me know. And then what I'll probably do, should I should I call you again in a month's time. Or two weeks or.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, maybe a couple of weeks.
Speaker 3
But what do you fancy? In a couple of weeks, let's call you in a couple of weeks and see how you getting on.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. OK, then cool. All right. Then. All right then, OK.
Speaker 3
Lovely. Well, nice to speak. Oh, I'm actually going on holiday in October. The around the 14th. So I'll call you before the 14th.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. We're only yeah. OK.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Is that all? Right.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, no problem. Right then. All right. Cheers. Bye now.
Speaker 3
Lovely. Perfect. Okey dokey. Take care. Bye for now. Bye bye.

Honestly, there's so many, yeah.

The hospitals and all these old men.
00:03:01 Speaker 2
Obviously, honestly. And then he's trying to fit his patience in as well. But yeah, so it's all kind of a bit of a struggle, but these next two weeks are quite mental with everything going on.
00:03:12 Speaker 2
Of course. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's good that you've got all the appointments, but it's a lot going on, isn't it?
00:03:12 Speaker 3
OK. Yes, yes, yes, that should work.
00:03:19 Speaker 2
And obviously there's.
00:03:20 Speaker 2
A lot of anxiety there building.
00:03:22 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, definitely. We thought everything.

OK. Yes, nice.
00:03:32 Speaker 2
Yeah, you see what I mean? So we've got like about four or five.
00:03:35 Speaker 2
Appointments or. Ohh.
00:03:37 Speaker 2
My goodness 2.
00:03:39 Speaker 2
Yeah. So I'm. I'm obviously really anxious about the test, (patient name) kind of has to her stays where he talked about it. As if to say like this suits that he he doesn't think that he's going to be here next year.
00:03:42 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
00:03:50 Speaker 2
And it's really interesting how he thinks like that, because I don't think like that. And he does and it's interesting, but I think that he kind of he has. That's it. That's the only time that I hear him talk negatively. He just so I don't, I don't think I'll be here next year because this is this this will be what will get me. But then other times you know he's doing really well with his.
00:04:11 Speaker 2
Buy it with.
00:04:12 Speaker 2
The raw vegan as much as he can, but.
00:04:14 Speaker 2
Also his characters.
00:04:15 Speaker 2
Whether this will help, we'll see with the results won't be next week.
00:04:19 Speaker 2
But he's.
00:04:19 Speaker 2
Kind of like the right attitude with that and he's, you know, he feels really good and he's had a very positive and.
00:04:27 Speaker 2
He is fine with.
00:04:29 Speaker 2
All the UM, you know, he's not scared. If if he does have to have chemo, but he's also keeping thinking that this is what will, you know, he just keeps thinking like, oh, well, I won't be next year, you know?
00:04:39 Speaker 2
Tell us some of the things that he's doing, preparing the stuff, you know, just in case. And it's like, I don't know, I.
00:04:45 Speaker 2
Just I think that it is.
00:04:47 Speaker 2
It is hitting him, but he's not letting it on. I think that's how it's going, you know, and we're trying not to talk about it because, you know, also it's like, well, what can we what can you do? But it's just a case of taking it in his stride, doesn't it? But yeah, it's just he's quite easy at being quite active and and everything.
00:05:00 Speaker 4
Yeah, we'll see.
00:05:07 Speaker 2
OK. Like we don't find that he's, you know, breathless much or.
00:05:10 Speaker 2
Is nothing. No, it's not affected him at.
00:05:11 Speaker 3
Anything like that now? No.
00:05:14 Speaker 2
All, and I know, I know. I wouldn't know. You genuinely like if you saw him, everyone suspended it really well.
00:05:15 Speaker 3
Really good, then, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I mean you.
00:05:22 Speaker 2
So nobody is even aware of it. But he's really pushing himself like he's not stopping. And then I think what's hardest for him is that he's got this pain in the hip which is causing him not to sleep.
00:05:36 Speaker 4
Again, yeah, yeah.
00:05:37 Speaker 2
Do you remember?
00:05:38 Speaker 2
That was kind of.
00:05:38 Speaker 2
Yeah. And that gets you really down, doesn't it?
00:05:41 Speaker 2
And you just.
00:05:43 Speaker 2
Be yeah.
00:05:44 Speaker 2
Sometimes, if you're not, if you got paid, yeah.
00:05:46 Speaker 2
I think that's what it is.
00:05:49 Speaker 2
You know, like we have to.
00:05:50 Speaker 2
Go to this course to London.
00:05:52 Speaker 2
And even that, you know, I just, I feel for him because I think he said something like we don't talk about it too much because like I say, you don't want to get you down kind of thing. But every now and again to say stuff like he is struggling with the leg even though that, yes, he's got more mobility, it's better than it could have been, you know, and all of that. But it's still not right. And I think that.
00:06:12 Speaker 2
The restrictions it slows him down, but I think that when he had the injection.
00:06:12
It is.
00:06:18 Speaker 2
He was much better and I think it's all down to this constant pain which does get to you, doesn't it? It does it does. It really gets on to your nerves and just your your whole.
00:06:27 Speaker 3
It does. Yeah, yeah, I.
00:06:30 Speaker 2
You know.
00:06:30 Speaker 2
Don't think everything's a struggle, so I genuinely think that it's this constant pain plus the fact he's not sleeping again, but he is a free gambling, so that's amazing.
00:06:32 Speaker 3
Yeah, it is.
00:06:41 Speaker 2
So that's really good. But yeah, I do think that this injection would have really been great. But now with the offer then he's a little bit worried because also he's got to have the OH God.
00:06:55 Speaker 2
The addiction to dumb it all. What's it called?
00:06:57 Speaker 3
Or the anaesthetic.
00:06:59 Speaker 2
Yeah. Now he's got numbing from the last anaesthetic.
00:07:03 Speaker 3
Right. OK.
00:07:03 Speaker 2
So he's to get worried about the knock on effect he knows. He knows that it's all part of the risk assessment. He takes all of his stride, but because he's got, they've got to go in again for like the third time basically into that side of the leg. He's just a little bit worried cause he's still got numbing. He doesn't, you know, it's the feeling of this numbness. It's like, yeah, it's a bit of everything. And then it's like.
00:07:08 Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:15 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 Speaker 2
What? What could it affect? Cause it could affect more stuff again and it's like it's just like is it worth it? But then at the same time I said look you're in.
00:07:32 Speaker 2
You can't think properly, but yes, she.
00:07:35 Speaker 2
Have a knock on effect from the other, so yeah, it's just that I think the general aesthetic isn't the problem. I think it's.
00:07:39 Speaker 3
Yeah, OK. Yeah.
00:07:44 Speaker 2
Him being done in.
00:07:45 Speaker 2
Spine. What's that called?
00:07:48 Speaker 2
Ohh gosh yeah, I know.
00:07:50 Speaker 3
What you mean?
00:07:51
That's the one I think.
00:07:52 Speaker 2
It's that thing has you're right. Epidural you.
00:07:55 Speaker 2
Have to thinking that when you when you know the ladies.
00:07:59 Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't think it's the upper jaw roll that's affecting you. It's affecting.
00:08:04 Speaker 2
And that's what you have the effects from. So we're trying to find out from the member of staff that works for artist, whether or not he has to have the epidural and whether or not because then also, you know, he when you speak after he's like oh, it only takes 15 minutes when you speak to the receptionist.
00:08:24 Speaker 2
Then, Oh well, we need to allow two to three hour op, and then we we are keeping him in overnight. So it's not a small op, but artistic. He makes our cities. Judith knows it's not. And it's like, you know, and then it's like the unknown cause now like obviously it's a bit on hold again because of you.
00:08:41 Speaker 2
Well, will you be able to dance? What will he be able to do? Will he be able to work? And it's like everything was a bit up in the air. But it's like at the same.
00:08:50 Speaker 2
Is there a good time? There's not really, but the pain.
00:08:53 Speaker 2
Is getting here because he can't walk far. And it's. Yeah. Yeah, I think it needs to be done, but it's just to say that it needs to be done. Let's put it that way. So I know that's it, but it's affecting the light.
00:08:56
It should.
00:09:05 Speaker 2
Isn't it so?
00:09:06 Speaker 3
It it is actually, yeah, yeah.
00:09:09 Speaker 2
Yeah. Can you know, I mean, I know any operation, there's the, you know, the after effects isn't there and you know, healing again and everything. But in the long run.
00:09:13 Speaker 3
OK.
00:09:19 Speaker 2
Never really got to him. That never really got to him that that kind of and it it's not cutting the muscle.
00:09:28 Speaker 2
Is it or?
00:09:30 Speaker 2
You know, last time it was the muscle. It's.
00:09:31 Speaker 2
The nerve in.
00:09:32 Speaker 2
Theory. It's the wire that's wrapped around the upper implant and also these classes which are doing nothing. So you'd like to think that then it starts to be a healing pain rather than a constant pain.
00:09:46 Speaker 2
But I don't know.
00:09:46 Speaker 4
Yes. Yeah, yes, yes.
00:09:48 Speaker 2
So this is so.
00:09:49 Speaker 2
Everything's a little bit up in the air, but also on top there. It's like not.
00:09:53 Speaker 2
Knowing if this test thing and then it's like yeah, if your test X-ray comes back then it's grown low.
00:10:00 Speaker 2
Foods then it's like I think (patient name) will obviously probably stop doing the dentistry a lot, a lot more like in as far as at the minute he's saying like I'm gonna go part time, but I could see that it might make him think, actually life's too.
00:10:15 Speaker 2
Short you know.
00:10:15 Speaker 2
I need to now concentrate on having the business cope without me.
00:10:20 Speaker 2
It is. It's very much all dependent on that. And I also think.
00:10:23 Speaker 4
OK.
00:10:24 Speaker 2
That he wants to.
00:10:26 Speaker 2
Travelling but you know, go on a holiday a bit more. But it's just it's really hard. But I think if it if the chest X-ray comes back, then it's staying the same or a little bit. Yeah. You know, that kind of thing. I think he probably told on doing what he's doing. So he's very much like, you know. And then now he's thinking right I'm going to sell the house because he's like he's been thinking about downsizing.
00:10:47 Speaker 2
At one point he thought he wasn't going to sell, but now I think because he's preparing.
00:10:52 Speaker 2
So it's all a little bit I I.
00:10:54 Speaker 2
Feel for him.
00:10:55 Speaker 2
There, he's not saying much. I genuinely think that.
00:10:58 Speaker 2
Loads of things that go around his head and I think that he is just kind of preparing for in a way the worst as well in his head. So he's.
00:11:06 Speaker 4
Pulling out.
00:11:06 Speaker 2
Pairing with the girls like he's getting stuff done, like trying to buy them stuff so that he like have property to rent out so that he can not worry about their future and stuff so.
00:11:16 Speaker 2
I think he's really like trying to weigh it all up in his head, so it's not. It's when he's not sleeping very.
00:11:21 Speaker 4
Well, so no, it's not. It's it. No, that's.
00:11:24 Speaker 2
It that's it. I mean, he he he's just very, you know, he just gets on with it, doesn't he? Where all these thoughts going round? Yeah. And nobody knows. Nobody knows. But I mean obviously, you know, and even his girls, he doesn't say much to his girl and even this girls see it's interesting because they're quite one of them.
00:11:30 Speaker 2
And he's.
00:11:34
Right.
00:11:35 Speaker 4
Yeah. No, no.
00:11:43 Speaker 2
Is a real like.
00:11:44 Speaker 2
She's really negative. She's quite draining. She's she's OK, she's.
00:11:49 Speaker 2
Guts as well.
00:11:51 Speaker 2
Though she's one of those that it's, it's really hard. Actually. I get frustrated with it because.
00:11:55 Speaker 2
She, you know, or be about (patient name), but she makes it about her because she's more stressed than (patient name) is about it. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And that doesn't help him because she makes it. Then it's exhausting for the three of us who love the other daughter because we're having to kind of carry on staying strong and fighting and working hard. So she's like, I need my my break and I.
00:12:16 Speaker 2
Need to cope because I'm coping with that.
00:12:18 Speaker 2
Like, you know, populations and it's like, you know.
00:12:20 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
00:12:21 Speaker 2
And it's it's very hard.
00:12:23 Speaker 2
He doesn't need that sort of attitude. It's exhausting said. It's harder on everybody else in the work and but she's very much, you know, it's all about her. So it's it's quite hard because you've kind of got somebody that's quite negative in the loop. But anyway, even though those two.
00:12:40 Speaker 2
The Minutes they've stopped talking about it for the minute because it's been such a long time ago since we found out we've all actually tried to kind of probably we're all doing the same. It's just getting on with it. There's nothing we can do so.
00:12:52 Speaker 2
People turn up all the emotions and.
00:12:54 Speaker 2
Turn up all the.
00:12:56 Speaker 2
Kind of negative of, you know, because she was talking negatively. I turned it into a positive. I said, look, you know, it could be worse. It could be that he could be.
00:13:04 Speaker 2
Kevin, keep it straight away.
00:13:05 Speaker 2
Blah blah blah and you know.
00:13:07 Speaker 2
So then she's like, OK. Yeah, I see your point of.
00:13:10 Speaker 2
And then she says, oh, can I tell people they're like, no, can you not tell people because your dad doesn't want people to know that she loves telling everybody everything? So it's quite a kind of frustrating thing at the beginning. And now it's calmed down. But I know that next we call it, those things will come back up again. And. Yeah. So it's just a little bit of it. And then it's like.
00:13:30 Speaker 2
Or do you tell the staff?
00:13:31 Speaker 2
Or do you know?
00:13:34 Speaker 2
So yes, but we can use that we can use in this hip as an excuse as to why (patient name) needs to take.
00:13:34 Speaker 4
Yeah. So yeah.
00:13:40 Speaker 4
Time off. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
00:13:41 Speaker 2
And it's been quite helpful.
00:13:43 Speaker 2
Yeah. Otherwise yeah. Otherwise.
00:13:44 Speaker 3
I know.
00:13:47 Speaker 2
I mean till you actually know the facts as well, you don't be, you know, telling people when you you know, what's going on, questions, won't they?
00:13:55 Speaker 2
Exactly and totally. And it's like all the unknown. And to be honest with you as well, I know this sounds really sad, but you know, like it doesn't take many months for people to forget. And it's one of those things that if (patient name) had told them all three or four months ago.
00:14:12 Speaker 2
What would have happened is now the empathy wears off and they don't care as much. And I know that sounds horrible, but it's.
00:14:19 Speaker 2
True, yeah.
00:14:21 Speaker 2
Well, if you didn't tell them, if you tell them now in two weeks time, you get the maximum of help when you need it. If that's what happens, because then (patient name) needs treatment. If yes, (patient name) still doesn't need treat.
00:14:34 Speaker 2
I don't I question that you should in a way, what's the point of telling people you truly need to.
00:14:39 Speaker 2
It's a bit of a.
00:14:40 Speaker 2
Battle, but that's where we're at. So yeah, and.
00:14:45 Speaker 2
No one's got their own point of view and you know, it's great. He's got you. It's fantastic. He's got you organised.
00:14:47 Speaker 3
Yeah, it's really hard then.
00:14:52 Speaker 1
Yeah, because.
00:14:54 Speaker 2
To keep him kind of up beat, and I mean, I know he generally.
00:14:57 Speaker 3
Is, isn't he? Yes.
00:14:58 Speaker 2
He is, yeah. But like, so it's just to try and juggle it all with it all. So yeah, it's like, be swinging on the other phone. Let me two seconds. I just let him.
00:15:06 Speaker 2
Know that I'm on the phone to you. Hang on.
00:15:07 Speaker 3
OK. All right.
00:15:14 Speaker 3
OK, good.
00:15:26 Speaker 2
Sorry, the line. He's just one. I know he's in between patients. Just two seconds.
00:15:41 Speaker 2
Yeah. So it's all a juggle and it's just a little bit of a watch. The steps two weeks is, isn't it? It's just the unknown, isn't.
00:15:48 Speaker 3
It really. And yeah, and if if you. Yeah.
00:15:48 Speaker 2
Yeah, definitely, definitely. So that's why I wanted to bring you because it's easier really living.
00:15:54 Speaker 3
Thank you. I'll relay all these.
00:15:55 Speaker 2
Back to to Rebecca I.
00:15:57 Speaker 3
Think she's just gone for lunch? Actually, but.

So obviously I'll let you know. And so I'm pretty confident that we're going to cancel the injection. That's what we're quite comfortable.

We're just waiting for Arter to come back to us so it's just a case of making no exactly so it's just the case is now really the the next main thing is just to tell you what the results are for the scan.

This is a locally advanced rectal cancer.

And then they'll potentially scan it and they'll they'll do a surgery.
Speaker 2
OK, so planning for chemotherapy. They're not too much sure how long that, but five weeks of radiotherapy and then hopefully surgery after that. OK, fantastic. Thank you (patient name). Umm, so in terms of retraining and our support, UM, so with us, you would get, who's your employer? Sorry.
Speaker 3
CBRE limited.
Speaker 2
CBR E. Fantastic. And have you spoke to you yet about your policy?
Speaker 3
I spoke to Unum right. Sorry, what? What was your question?
Speaker 2
So so your policy with you know, is it a critical illness policy?
Speaker 3
I think so. So I had that critical illness insurance as well. So I asked my HR, they gave me some link where I filled your.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Perfect.
Speaker 3
And the HR kind of give me leaflet from owner as well, which is more like a Cancer Support service.
Speaker 2
Yes, they're real accounts and support service, but you've put in your forms for union, for the critical illness policy. Yeah, fantastic. OK, brilliant. That's fine. Just wanted to make sure that was there. So in terms of reframe the Council support part of their service. So you get 2 years of support from us. And with that you get a. Cancer Support manager who can help with more of the practical side of things. So if there's test results that need chasing or appointments and you chasing or you want us to source local support for you in terms of complementary therapies or you may want counselling if that's something you're interested in. Basically, anything that was going to be helpful to you. You know, a lot of people struggle to get through to their GP. We can do that for you and just try and make things a little bit easier. And then with that support manager you also get a cancer specialist and they can. Help with all. The the more clinical questions that you may have so questions around chemotherapy, radiotherapy pre surgical questions that you may have post surgical checkins, things like that. Anything clinically related to your cancer diagnosis, they can support you through that as well. And those two, those two people will remain the same throughout the two years of the support. So you don't have to, you know, repeat yourself or, you know, tell someone a whole new A whole new person, the what's happened and everything. It's all kept between the two people to support you. UM, you are UM. Well, any any questions about that at all or anything else you may think or?
Speaker 3
If you don't mind, 59 is little bits of that. If you. Yeah, I just miss few things in meetings. Could you go through that once again? Sorry about that.
Speaker 2
Oh yeah, sure, of course. Sorry. UM, so so the support manager will help with more. Of the practical side. Thing there anything that you may be interested in in terms of complementary therapies? So a lot of when people are having chemotherapy or radiotherapy, they unfortunately suffer side effects and and some of those complementary therapies can help alleviate that or just help with relaxation. And we would look.
Speaker 3
What kind of complementary therapies you're talking?
Speaker 2
So that could be something like reflexology or acupuncture. Just massage things like that.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
And we would look locally for things like that for you to try and find free options. But if you were looking for things that were maybe private, you could. We could look for that as well for you. We don't cover the cost of anything for things like that. That would be covered like for by you, but if. So like I said, we always look for things that are free for you. First of all, anyway, before we would even look privately if that was something you were interested in.
Speaker 3
OK. Because I have a insurance, so obviously because. Sort of guide me that whether my insurance would cover it.
Speaker 2
Yeah, of course. Yeah. If you've got private medical insurance as well, that may cover some of those. Complementary therapies. Absolutely we can. Look at those as well.
Speaker 3
OK. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah.
Speaker 2
UM, so if obviously you are, I don't know what? What hospital are you with at the moment?
Speaker 3
So there is a right now it's with (hospital name), but I'm thinking to move the treatment to a private hospital.
Speaker 2
OK. Yep.
Speaker 3
Obviously it's been just last week, so I'll I have a appointment with the oncologist coming Monday. Yeah, on Monday I'll decide maybe what to do, but yeah, most likely. I'll. I'll go with private treatment, OK.
Speaker 2
So this appointment on Monday is that with the NHS?
Speaker 3
This appointment on Monday, it's. You know, this is this is private. My case has given me appointment with the same oncologist on Friday. So because this was like, was getting this like 4 days earlier. So I I went private.
Speaker 2
OK. OK. Yeah, that. Makes sense. So you're seeing the the following Friday, so next Friday is the NHS one, but you could see the private see the privately on the Monday. Yeah, yeah. OK. Brilliant. OK, well, that's really helpful then at least you're getting sooner and obviously going privately if it's. If it's more suitable for you, then that's better.
Speaker 3
Obviously one of my question would be and I understand if you can't answer, but because I have the private insurance and. Yeah, NHS are doing all the bits as well so. In such cases, is it worth going private? Like what are the pros and cons in such treatments? I know NHS can have delays sometimes, so that's one. But yeah, apart from that. Like if I have it. So should I just use it the private insurance?
Speaker 2
Yeah, it is. It is really down to you. It may be that the some of the pros could be that the hospital is closer to you. It could be that the facilities themselves are a lot better. You may be getting seen sooner. Your test results may come back quicker there. There are a lot of pros to going privately, but I wouldn't say for certain yes or no. You know, private is the way to go. You know, you may have a fantastic experience on the NHS, like a lot of people do. It really does depend on the. The hospital and the trust.
Speaker 3
Yeah, it's like friendly. I have had great experience as of now. Only thing is. With the NHS, it's always like 2 to 3 weeks delays, so even after diagnosis they took about. 10 days to sort of confirm convey me the result.
Speaker 2
It's a long time to wait, isn't it? And if you're able to get that halved or even less on privately, then you'd do it, wouldn't you?
Speaker 3
Yeah, probably. That in itself is a good reason because. I think this thing comes with a lot of anxiety in itself, and sometimes it's it's not too good to just wait. So yeah, thanks for that. Carry on with with whatever you.
Speaker 2
Discussing no, thanks. So yes. So in terms of the support the support manager can can help with you know chasing appointments and test results and things. But obviously if you are planning to go privately, hopefully that will be very quick anyway. But we can make contact with your oncologists. Secretary just to be, you know, on the ball with them and just if there is anything delayed wise we can keep in touch with them and make sure everything is moving smoothly, if that's something that's going. UM, and then for the nurses, so they will be able to help clinically around any questions that you may have. So you might have a lot of questions coming out from with regards to what chemotherapy you may have, what that could mean for you side effect wise? And again with radiotherapy, what to expect with side effects and if you do start getting side effects, what you can do to alleviate those side effects and they. Can provide suggestions for you. And then obviously around, sorry.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Go on.
Speaker 2
Go on and then obviously around surgery as well, getting you prepared for surgery, any questions you may have around that and anything that you know again if anything happens side effect wise or any effects that happen after the surgery, they can discuss that with you as well you'll you'll have lots of fantastic. Support around your nurses at the hospital as well. We're we're here more as a secondary service, so if you get, if you don't follow, you're getting your questions answered or or have some, you know, a little quick question that you can't get through to the nurses at the hospital for. We can be there for.
Speaker 3
Yeah. And I think that will be helpful because there are always questions there are.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. It's always passion. Yeah, absolutely. And no question is a silly question. Every question is worth being answered. So don't worry. And and in terms. Of how we would communicate with you so. You can call us and you can chat with us and you can e-mail with us. So our opening hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 5:30. And so any time and then you can either call and speak to one of your team members. Or you can send a chat, so when if you're happy to sign up, like I say, it's free of charge. There's nothing to you. And if you have to sign up, we'll send you an e-mail, which will get you. Registered up to our. Portal and in the portal is the chat function and you can chat on there with us and send messages and questions and things like that if. You don't want to call. But you can call or you can e-mail us, but obviously we prefer to use chat and calls wherever we possibly can because it's secure in the portal as well. So your emails aren't going to go missing. And and that's I think that's kind of it at the moment, unless you had any other questions around the support or anything that was particularly of. Interest to you?
Speaker 3
Now I think if I got it right, it's kind of a secondary support. If I have questions, I can always talk to someone. They are they. Probably as someone who kind of had expert in it, so they may answer it or they may they, they can come back with an answer in some time they may can help find answers.
Speaker 2
Yes, yes.
Speaker 3
And yeah, if I have like. Say I'm getting some sort of fatigue. I may check to them and they may suggest few things, some exercises that sort of stuff, right?
Speaker 2
Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely, (patient name), you've got that correct completely.
Speaker 3
It's not, uh. Kind of support where like if I need say after surgery I need some transport so you won't be able to help with that.
Speaker 2
We may be able to help with that. You know, we may be able to, but you may have better luck obviously speaking directly with the hospital. They may have local much better local knowledge, but you can certainly ask some real. Certainly try and help.
Speaker 3
OK, cool. No, I'm I'm really happy. And and always good to talk to someone who knows a bit about it. So what should I do? Should I just sign up?
Speaker 2
Yeah, absolutely. If you're happy too. So I can take your details down. Let me just confirm the spelling of your name again. So it was G.
Speaker 3
And I already submitted the critical insurance cover form.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
Speaker 3
That's with you. So you are not with Unum at the. Moment you are this HSC, right?
Speaker 2
So we're yeah, so we're we used to be called HSC. We're now called reframe. And so we don't have any hold any of your details Unum until let me just check if I don't think those centres over your referral yet, let me just double.
Speaker 3
OK. Yeah, they might not have. I just did it yesterday, you mean?
Speaker 2
Yeah. So that might take a few days. So I don't have any details yet, but we'll get your referral in, which is fine. We can we can get you signed up now we don't have to wait for the referral to come through.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 2
OK. Can I just confirm the spelling of your name again then? So it is (patient name).
Speaker 3
That's right.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And your second name was (patient name). Your last name. Thank you. And so can I take a contact number for you?
Speaker 3
(phone number)
Speaker 2
(phone number)


Speaker 3
Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2
And your e-mail address.
Speaker 3
That would be my first name last name. At gmail.com there is a slight change. So in the last name after R you have to put 2A's instead of one. Yeah? So it would be.
Speaker 2
2A's, OK. And then (patient name)?
Speaker 3
Yeah, I'll just spell it once more. (patient name) @gmail.com.
Speaker 2
I've got a. OK, so I'll uh, log you into the system and then I'll pop you an e-mail over shortly which will give you a link to complete the sign up process. Set the password and then you'll be into the portal and then once you've logged into the portal we you will be assigned your support manager and counsellor specialist and they. They'll then send you a message into the portal to arrange a call to introduce themselves.
Speaker 3
OK. Makes sense. Thank you.
Speaker 2
OK, glad if you've got any other questions, please do feel free to give me a call, but otherwise, please expect an. E-mail shortly, OK.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Alright. That's really helpful. Thank you so much. Take care.
Speaker
Right.
Speaker 2
No problem. You have a good day. Take care. Bye.
